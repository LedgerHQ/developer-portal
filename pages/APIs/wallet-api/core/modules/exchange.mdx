# Using the Exchange Module in Wallet API Core Client

The Exchange Module facilitates various exchange operations such as starting the exchange process, completing swap, sell, and fund transactions using Ledger Live.

## Exchange Module Overview

Access the Exchange module via `walletApiClient.exchange`.

### Methods:

#### 1. Start Exchange

Start the exchange process by generating a nonce on Ledger device. This method is typically called before completing the exchange process.

```javascript
walletApiClient.exchange.start(exchangeType: 'SWAP' | 'SELL' | 'FUND'): Promise<{ transactionId: string }>
```

**Parameters**:
- `exchangeType` (required): A string specifying the type of exchange operation (`"SWAP"`, `"SELL"`, or `"FUND"`).

**Returns**: A promise that resolves with an object containing the `transactionId` which is used to complete the exchange process.

##### Example:

```javascript
async function startExchange(walletApiClient, exchangeType) {
  try {
    const { transactionId } = await walletApiClient.exchange.start(exchangeType);
    console.log('Transaction ID:', transactionId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error starting exchange:', error);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Complete Exchange

Complete an exchange process (swap, sell, or fund) by passing the exchange content and its signature.

```javascript
walletApiClient.exchange.complete(params: {
  provider: string,
  fromAccountId: string,
  rawTransaction: RawTransaction,
  hexBinaryPayload: string,
  hexSignature: string,
  feeStrategy: 'SLOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'FAST',
  exchangeType: 'SWAP' | 'SELL' | 'FUND',
  toAccountId?: string,
  swapId?: string,
  rate?: number,
}): Promise<{ transactionHash: string }>
```

**Parameters**: An object containing:
- `provider` (required): A string used to verify the signature.
- `fromAccountId` (required): Identifier of the account used as a source for the transaction.
- `rawTransaction` (required): A RawTransaction object containing the transaction details.
- `hexBinaryPayload` (required): Hexadecimal string representing the blueprint of the data that will be allowed for signing.
- `hexSignature` (required): Hexadecimal string ensuring the source of the payload.
- `feeStrategy` (required): A string representing the fee strategy (`"SLOW"`, `"MEDIUM"`, or `"FAST"`).
- `exchangeType` (required): A string specifying the type of exchange operation (`"SWAP"`, `"SELL"`, or `"FUND"`).
- `toAccountId` (optional): Identifier of the account used as a destination (required for `"SWAP"`).
- `swapId` (optional): Identifier of the backend swap used (required for `"SWAP"`).
- `rate` (optional): Swap rate used in the transaction (required for `"SWAP"`).

**Returns**: A promise that resolves with an object containing the `transactionHash` of the broadcasted transaction.

##### Example:

```javascript
async function completeExchange(walletApiClient, exchangeParams) {
  try {
    const { transactionHash } = await walletApiClient.exchange.complete(exchangeParams);
    console.log('Transaction Hash:', transactionHash);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error completing exchange:', error);
  }
}
```

## Handling Errors

Make sure to handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to the user. Additionally, always remember to disconnect the `WindowMessageTransport` when you're done interacting with the Ledger Wallet API to free up resources.
