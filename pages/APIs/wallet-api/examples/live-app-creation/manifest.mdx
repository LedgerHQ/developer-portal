### 9. **Creating a Manifest File**

A manifest file is necessary to test your Live App inside Ledger Live. Create a `manifest.json` file at the root of your project. Here is a sample manifest you can use:

```json
{
  "id": "SampleLiveApp",
  "name": "SampleLiveApp",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "params": {
    "dappUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",
    "nanoApp": "SampleLiveApp",
    "dappName": "SampleLiveApp",
    "networks": [
      {
        "currency": "ethereum",
        "chainID": 1,
        "nodeURL": "..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "platform": ["ios","android","desktop"],
  "apiVersion": "^2.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "2",
  "branch": "stable",
  "categories": ["NFT", "Swap", "YourAppCategory"],
  "currencies": "*",
  "content": {
    "shortDescription": {
      "en": "Desc"
    },
    "description": {
      "en": "Desc"
    }
  },
  "permissions": [],
  "domains": ["http://*"],
  "visibility": "complete"
}
```

### 10. **Importing Manifest in Ledger Live**

Ensure Ledger Live Desktop is installed on your computer. Enable Developer mode in Ledger Live by navigating to **Settings** -> **About**, and clicking ten times on the Ledger Live version. This will reveal a new **Developer** section in the settings menu.

- Enable **platform dev tools**.
- Click on **Browse** next to **Add a local app** and select the manifest you created.

Now you'll see a new row in the menu with the name of your Live App. You can now open and test your Live App within Ledger Live.
