# Using the `useRequestAccount` hook

The `useRequestAccount` hook is part of the Ledger Wallet API Client for React. It is used to request an account from the Ledger Wallet. When the hook is called, the user will be prompted to select the desired account.

### Introduction

The `useRequestAccount` hook facilitates requesting access to a userâ€™s account. On component mount, the user will be prompted to select an account from the Ledger Wallet.

### Usage

1. Import the necessary dependencies and hooks from the Wallet API Client.

2. Use the `useRequestAccount` hook in your component.

3. Call the `requestAccount` function within a `useEffect` to prompt the user to select an account when the component mounts.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `useRequestAccount` hook within a simple React application:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useRequestAccount } from "@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react";

function App() {
  // Use the useRequestAccount hook
  const { requestAccount, account } = useRequestAccount();
  // State to store the response
  const [response, setResponse] = useState(null);

  // Prompt the user to select an account on component mount
  useEffect(() => {
    requestAccount();
  }, [requestAccount]);

  // If needed you can filter the accounts by currency as follow
  useEffect(() => {
    const request = async () => {
      await requestAccount({ currencyIds: ['currency_id'] })
    }

    request();
  }, [requestAccount]);

  // Trigger a re-render after the user selects an account to handle the account response
  useEffect(() => {
    if (account) {
      setResponse(`${account.address} : ${account.id}`);
    }
  }, [account]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Test Live App - Wallet API</h1>
      <div className="card">
        {response ? (
          <p>Selected Account: {response}</p>
        ) : (
          <p>Selecting account...</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Parameters

The `requestAccount` accepts an object with a currencyIds property as parameter.

- `currencyIds`: An array of currencyIds.

### Return Value

The `useRequestAccount` hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `requestAccount`: A function to trigger the account selection prompt.
- `account`: The selected account object. It will be `null` until the user selects an account.

The account object typically contains the following properties:

- `id`: A string representing the account ID.
- `address`: A string representing the account address.

### Handling Responses

After invoking `requestAccount`, you can keep track of the `account` object to determine if the user has selected an account. Once selected, the `account` object will populate with the relevant account information.
