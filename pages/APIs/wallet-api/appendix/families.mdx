# Cryptocurrencies and Families

In the ever-evolving realm of digital assets, the multitude of available cryptocurrencies is both a testament to the technology's potential and a challenge for all its users. While these currencies may appear similar on the surface, they are actually quite diverse, each with unique features and purposes.

Navigating the varied terrain of cryptocurrencies can be a tedious task. The Wallet API directly addresses this challenge. It enables developers and businesses to seamlessly transact across numerous cryptocurrencies.

## Supported Crypto Families

To navigate this multitude of cryptocurrencies more efficiently, we've created 'Families' - a novel way to group cryptocurrencies that share similar APIs due to their common architecture. This intuitive classification offers a simplified way to manage and transact with multiple digital currencies that share foundational features. Some cryptocurrency families will be centered on a single cryptocurrency, others will have many members.

Please note that actual available cryptocurrencies implementation will depend on both the wallet and the app's permissions.
