# Wallet API Simulator

The Simulator is a tool provided by Ledger that allows developers to test their application without interacting with the real Ledger Live application.

It provides a mock environment with a set of predefined responses for different Wallet API actions.
This enables you to develop and test your application safely.

## Target audience

This documentation and the Wallet API library are dedicated to developers building Live Apps that are intended to be embedded within a wallet implementing the Wallet API Server like [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live).

## Overview

The Wallet API Simulator library empowers you to:

- **Easily develop your Live App in the browser**: Establish a fake connection to the Simulator acting as a wallet implementing the Wallet API Server, like Ledger Live would do.

- **Test in more ways**: The simulator facilitate writing E2E, integration or unit tests, by allowing mocking any data used.

- **Simulate errors that are hard to reproduce**: Just like you can write tests for the good path, you should also test your error handling code.

## Navigating the documentation

This documentation is structured to provide you with a clear understanding of the various features and utilities available in the Ledger Wallet API Simulator library.

- **Getting Started**: If you're new to this library, begin with the [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) section. It guides you through the installation process.

- **Configuration**: The [Configuration](./configuration.mdx) section contains information on how to add the simulator to your Live App.

- **Profiles**: Learn about the various [Profiles](./profiles.mdx) we export for use with the simulator, as well as utilities to customize the profiles.

We're thrilled to have you on board and excited to see the innovative Live Apps you build.
