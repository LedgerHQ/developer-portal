# Understanding the Simulator Profiles

The Simulator provides different profiles. These profiles are predefined sets of responses for various API actions.
For now, we recommend that you use `profiles.STANDARD` which includes a set of mock accounts, mock currencies, and method handlers.

### Mock Accounts and Currencies

The Simulator is set up with a predefined list of mock accounts and currencies. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the mock accounts and currencies used within the simulator:

### Mock Accounts

```json
[
  {
    "id": "account-btc-1",
    "name": "Bitcoin 1",
    "address": "address",
    "currency": "bitcoin",
    "balance": "42",
    "spendableBalance": "42",
    "blockHeight": 1,
    "lastSyncDate": "1995-12-17T03:24:00"
  },
  {
    "id": "account-eth-1",
    "name": "Ethereum 1",
    "address": "address",
    "currency": "ethereum",
    "balance": "42",
    "spendableBalance": "42",
    "blockHeight": 1,
    "lastSyncDate": "1995-12-17T03:24:00"
  }
]
```

### Mock Currencies

```json
[
  {
    "type": "CryptoCurrency",
    "id": "bitcoin",
    "ticker": "BTC",
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "family": "bitcoin",
    "color": "#ffae35",
    "decimals": 8
  },
  {
    "type": "CryptoCurrency",
    "id": "ethereum",
    "ticker": "ETH",
    "name": "Ethereum",
    "family": "ethereum",
    "color": "#0ebdcd",
    "decimals": 18
  }
]
```

These mock accounts and currencies are used to emulate a realistic Ledger Live environment. You can interact with these accounts and currencies through the API without affecting any real-world assets.

### Wrapping Up

By using the Simulator, you can streamline the development and testing of your application with the Ledger Wallet API. This allows you to develop and test your Ledger Live integration in a safe and controlled environment. Don't forget to thoroughly test with real devices and the live environment before releasing your application.
