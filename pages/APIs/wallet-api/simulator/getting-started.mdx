# Getting Started

In this guide, we will walk through how to set up the Ledger Wallet API simulator to connect the client to a mock environment, instead of the real Ledger Live environment.

This is especially helpful during development and testing phases, where you might not want to perform actions on the real Ledger Live.

## Installation

Let's begin by installing the base package.

You can use your favorite package manager, npm, yarn or pnpm, to install the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator
```

---

Now that you've successfully installed the necessary packages, you're ready to start crafting with Ledger's Wallet
API. In the next page, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and configuring the Wallet API in your
application.
