# Welcome to the Ledger Wallet API Client documentation

This library is exclusively designed to facilitate the seamless integration of decentralized applications (DApps), termed as Live Apps, within Ledger Live. It provides a streamlined way for Live Apps to communicate with Ledger hardware wallets via the Wallet API.

Whether you are developing a crypto asset management app, a decentralized exchange, or any other blockchain project, this library is equipped with a set of React hooks and utilities to ensure a secure and efficient user experience.


This library serves as a cornerstone for integrating applications within Ledger Live, dubbed as Live Apps, in a framework-agnostic manner. By leveraging the Wallet API Client, your Live App can interact with Ledger hardware wallets through Ledger Live.

## Target Audience

The Wallet API Client is tailored for developers seeking to build Live Apps for embedding within Ledger Live. It ensures smooth communication between the Live App and the userâ€™s Ledger hardware wallet through [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live).

We expect to widen the scope of the library in the future to support other use cases as well such as web apps connected to Ledger wallets though the [Ledger Extension](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-extension), but this is not yet supported.
