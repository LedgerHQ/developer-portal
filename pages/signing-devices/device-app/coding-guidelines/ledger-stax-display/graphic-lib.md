The library for handling the graphical aspects of your Embedded App on Stax is called [NBGL](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/tree/master/lib_nbgl). The NBGL Engine is responsible for constructing screens and handling Touchscreen input. 

For more information on how to use it, [build the documentation locally](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/tree/master/lib_nbgl) using Doxygen.
