# App submission

## Ready to submit your App for review?

The submission of a Ledger embedded app is completed through a form. This will ask you for all the various items required together in one place (use [the requirement list](./requirements/) as a checklist).

Once you have finished your work and you have collected all the App items you must enter them in the [form](https://ledger.typeform.com/app-submission).

Make sure you thoroughly complete the form to ensure a speedy release process.

	The integration process will only start if you answer accurately to all the questions.
