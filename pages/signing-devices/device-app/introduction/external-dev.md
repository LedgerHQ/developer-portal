## Need a team to build your Embedded App?

You need an embedded app but don't have an application developer in your team?   

The following companies have experience building Embedded Apps, feel free to contact them to talk about your project:
- [Blooo](https://blooo.io/en/ledger-wallet-integration/)
- [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems/)
- [Vacuum Labs](https://vacuumlabs.com/)
- [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/)

If you need more information, don't hesitate to contact us on Discord.

You can still try to start your project on your own, thanks to your development framework that contains everything you need to build an App, load it on a device or on an emulated OS, and test your App with Ragger. Get started [here](../framework/).
