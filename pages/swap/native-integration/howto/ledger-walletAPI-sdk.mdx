# Ledger's exchange SDK

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the swap, please follow this [tutorial](../../../docs/discover/non-dapp).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the ExchangeSDK, with the [swap](#swap) method.

You will need to set up the SDK with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

### swap
This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `quoteId`: the id coming from your system and [forwarded to your LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `fromAccountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the liveapp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `toAccountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the liveapp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `fromAmount`: amount that will be sent from `fromAddressId` to `payinAddress`
* `rate`: rate differences in the pair, [previously given to the liveapp](../providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.

This method rely on the [WalletAPI](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/introduction).

```js copy
  exchangeSDK.swap({
    quoteId: "1234",

    toAccountId: "76A239EB-1C2A-4237-B942-CA87472106EB",
    fromAmount: "12.3",
    feeStrategy: "SLOW",
    rate: 0.7555,    
  });
