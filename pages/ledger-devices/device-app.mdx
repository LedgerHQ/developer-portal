# What is an Embedded App?

<img style={{width: "250px", float:"right"}} src="/nanosplus.png"/>

There are three types of embedded apps: Classical embedded apps, DApp plugins, and utility applications. 

### Classical embedded apps
This is the application that allows the users to manage their crypto-assets with their Ledger devices. It is the first step to an integration of your coin or token to the Ledger environment and to an integration of your blockchain to Ledger Live. The following sections will help you develop this type of application. For more information about the role of the Ledger embedded app, read [this Academy article](https://www.ledger.com/academy/hardwarewallet/what-are-ledger-applications-and-why-do-i-need-them). 

### DApp plugins
DApp Plugins are developed to integrate an Ethereum DApp to Ledger live. Ledger Live has a DApp browser where your DApp will be visible and usable through an iframe. Ethereum DApps can be developed for example to lend or borrow, swap, trade, pay with cryptoassets or manage your portfolio. The documentation for DApp plugins is in the [Live App section](../../../ledger-live/discover).

### Utility applications
These applications leverage Ledger technology but are not involved in managing crypto assets. They interact with Ledger devices and BOLOS operating system and can serve many purposes. They can be, for example, a password manager application, or a two-factor authentication application. 

**You are developing a classical embedded App or a utility application, you are in the right section!**
