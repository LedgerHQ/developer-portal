# Frequently Asked Questions

| Question/Problem        |  Answer        | 
| --------------- | -------------- | 
| When trying to build a Ledger embedded app via the `make` command on some apps, this error could appear `fatal error: 'zxmacros.h' file not found` (or any other .h file).  | Run `git submodule update --init` on the repoâ€™s root or `git clone https://github.com/application.git" --recurse-submodules`. | 
| What is the maximum size of a message that can be sent in a single APDU?  | The length of the data part is 255 bytes and the whole message sent in a single APDU is 260 bytes with the blocks cla, ins, p1, p2 and one extra byte that encodes the length of the data that follows. | 
| The Ledger team can not fork a repo which is already a fork on LedgerHQ *(e.g. ledger-panacea is a clone of ledger-cosmos but LedgerHQ has already a fork of ledger-cosmos)*. | This is a limitation of GitHub and the only solution for this is to break the link between the repository and the upstream one. This is done like in this [tutorial](https://ralphjsmit.com/unfork-github-repo).  | 
| Can I freely choose the CLA in my embedded app as long as it is one byte or is there eanything I need to be aware of? | Apart from not using a few CLAs that are reserved for the SDK, OS, etc, developers are free to choose. For example, `0xB0` is for SDK.  | 
| How can I load an app without Ledger Live on my ledger nano S or S+?  | Here are the links to the documentation [for Linux users](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/embedded-app/load-linux/) and [for Mac users](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/embedded-app/load-mac/). |
| When do I have to build the Docker image?  | As Ledger provides these Docker images on the `ghcr.io` Docker repository (see [this page](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/embedded-app/app-builder-container/) for more details), you don't have to build the Docker image yourself. However if you do (instructions are [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/)), remember to update it every time a new SDK version is published. |
| When I build the application, I have this error message: `No targets specified and no makefile found`. | You need to go down one level in the repo to the app subfolder and then run the `make` command. You must have launched your ledger-app-builder before. | 
| I'm getting the error message `Ledger device: CLA_NOT_SUPPORTED`. | Many reasons could occur this error: the embedded app does not support the functionality you are implementing yet, you opened the wrong embedded app, or the CLA byte is not correctly set.| 
| How do I verify that my product is genuine (in CLI)? | You can check it by connecting your hardware wallet and executing the following commands in this [documentation](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382029329-Check-hardware-integrity?support=true). | 
| Could we submit an Embedded App for a developer release when the blockchain is still on testnet? | Yes, it's possible. | 
| GitHub actions are suddenly failing because the code rely on `brew`, what should I do? | You have to remove `brew` from the codebase. `brew` has been removed from GitHub base ubuntu images. This [link](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/ubuntu20/20220922.2/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-Readme.md) is the description of the latest ubuntu image. It points to the [issue](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/6283) where `brew` has been removed. |
