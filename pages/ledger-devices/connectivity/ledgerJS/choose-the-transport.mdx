# Choose the right transport

For the client's side device (Desktop & Mobile), several technologies can be used to communicate with Ledger hardware devices.

Based on your current service core technology, you could choose different types of integration. First of all, it will depend on your current service implementation technology.

### WebApp
For a web application three options are possible :
- Web HID
- Web USB
- Web Bluetooth (Nano X)
