# Info note

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

LedgerJS Transport libraries will soon be deprecated.

For any new project, we recommend you use the new Device Management Kit.

For existing projects, you can still access the LedgerJS documentation but we recommend that you consider updating your integration.

## Languages

| Type of App | Required skills  |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Web App     | JavaScript       |
| Mobile App  | React Native     |
| Desktop App | Electron/Node.js |

## Prerequisites

### Summary

To connect your app you will need to install:

- [Node (for Desktop apps) and NPM](#node-and-npm)
- [Ledger Live](#ledger-live-installation)
- [The Ledger Embedded App](#embedded-app-installation) of the coin that you are going to use (to use this documentation you will need Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana)
- At least [one account](#account-creation) for each coin (except for Solana).

### Node and NPM

If not already installed, install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node & npm</a>, choose the LTS version of your operating system. You can check if you have it installed by checking the version with the following commands:

```
$ node -v
v20.9.0

$ npm -v
10.5.0
```

The commands should print the versions of Node.js and npm accordingly. Ensure Node.JS is 20.9.0.

### Ledger Live Installation

Now that node and npm are installed, you have to install the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) desktop application to connect your Ledger device.
After the installation, open Ledger Live and go to the **Manager** tab.

Then connect your Ledger Nano to your computer and unlock it.

### Account Creation

To use the Bitcoin/Ethereum Embedded Apps you have to create a Bitcoin/Ethereum account.
We will present there the creation of a bitcoin account but it is the same for any application supported by Ledger Live.

To create your Bitcoin account:

- Launch the Bitcoin application on your Ledger Nano S/X/S Plus

- Open the Bitcoin app on your ledger device
