# Web USB/HID

## Introduction

In this section, we will guide you through the creation of a web application.  
The instructions for Web USB and Web HID are very similar, with only a few lines to comment out, so this is a combined walkthrough.  
This application will connect to your Nano to display the address of a Bitcoin account.
You can easily modify the code, if you want it for Ethereum.

Reference note: the packages referenced here are  
 Web USB: [@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-transport-webusb)  
 Web HID: [@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-transport-webhid).

## One-time setup

Make sure you go through the [Development Prerequisites](../../getting-started#prerequisites).

## App Coding (Desktop)

### App setup

For this tutorial, the folder will be named `example-web-hid-usb`, so that it can be used for either Web USB or Web HID.

From your `Github folder` or favourite `examples folder`, run:

```console copy
mkdir example-web-hid-usb
cd example-web-hid-usb
```

Initialize the project by running:

```console copy
npm init
```

Answer the questions displayed or by default press enter. There is no incidence on the execution.

Run:

```console copy
mkdir src
touch src/index.html
touch src/main.js
```

The folder will contain these files:

![Folder USB and HID](/device-interaction/folderUsbHid.png)
_Fig. 1: File structure_

### Files

Open the folder example-web-hid-usb in an code editor.

#### index.html

In index.html copy-paste the following code :

```html copy
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My First Embedded App</title>
    <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body id="main"></body>
</html>
```

#### main.js

In main.js copy-paste the following code:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Comment out or remove the `import` package you don't need <br />
  (`@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb` or `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid`) <br />
  and the `const transport` you don't use.
</Callout>

```javascript copy
import "core-js/actual";
import { listen } from "@ledgerhq/logs";
import AppBtc from "@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc";

// Keep this import if you want to use a Ledger Nano X/S Plus with the USB protocol and delete the @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid import
import TransportWebUSB from "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb";
// Keep this import if you want to use a Ledger Nano X/S Plus with the HID protocol and delete the @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb import
import TransportWebHID from "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid";

//Display the header in the div which has the ID "main"
const initial =
  "<h1>Connect your Nano and open the Bitcoin app. Click anywhere to start...</h1>";
const $main = document.getElementById("main");
$main.innerHTML = initial;

document.body.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  $main.innerHTML = initial;
  try {
    // Keep if you chose the USB protocol
    const transport = await TransportWebUSB.create();

    // Keep if you chose the HID protocol
    const transport = await TransportWebHID.create();

    //listen to the events which are sent by the Ledger packages in order to debug the app
    listen((log) => console.log(log));

    //When the Ledger device connected it is trying to display the bitcoin address
    const appBtc = new AppBtc({ transport, currency: "bitcoin" });
    const { bitcoinAddress } = await appBtc.getWalletPublicKey(
      "44'/0'/0'/0/0",
      { verify: false, format: "legacy" },
    );

    //Display your bitcoin address on the screen
    const h2 = document.createElement("h2");
    h2.textContent = bitcoinAddress;
    $main.innerHTML = "<h1>Your first Bitcoin address:</h1>";
    $main.appendChild(h2);

    //Display the address on the Ledger device and ask to verify the address
    await appBtc.getWalletPublicKey("44'/0'/0'/0/0", {
      format: "legacy",
      verify: true,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    //Catch any error thrown and displays it on the screen
    const $err = document.createElement("code");
    $err.style.color = "#f66";
    $err.textContent = String(e.message || e);
    $main.appendChild($err);
  }
});
```

#### Install the Transport HID or USB package

Then depending on your choice install one of the corresponding packages:

- Install the Ledger package [@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-transport-webhid) which provide you with all the methods to interact with your Nano with an HID connection:
  ```console copy
  npm install --save @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid
  ```
- Install the Ledger package [@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-transport-webusb) which provide you with all the methods to interact with your Nano with a USB connection:
  ```console copy
  npm install --save @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb
  ```

#### Package.json

Modify `"main": "index.js"` to `"source": "src/index.html"`.

And ensure you have this line in your package.json:

```javascript copy
  "scripts": {
    "build": "parcel build",
    "start": "parcel"
  },
```

Add this at the end of the script:

```javascript copy
  "alias": {
    "@ledgerhq/devices": "@ledgerhq/devices/lib-es"
  }
```

Your "package.json" should look like this:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  In the `dependencies` section of package.json, comment out or remove the line
  you don't need <br />
  (`@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb` or `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid`) <br />
  Do not copy-paste as is, without removing the other line.
</Callout>

```javascript copy
{
  "name": "update-doc-web-hid-usb",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "source": "src/index.html",
  "dependencies": {

    "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid": "^6.28.0",
    "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb": "^6.28.4",
    "@ledgerhq/logs": "^6.12.0",
    "core-js": "^3.33.3"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "parcel build",
    "start": "parcel"
  },
  "devDependencies": {

## App Coding (Android Chrome)

Android chrome supports HID and USB.  
For smartphones, only Android supports web applications.  
For Android, only Chrome supports web application.

### package.json

To test your application on android, a little change has to be made.  
Add the `--https` flag in your `"start"` script

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  In the `dependencies` section of package.json, comment out or remove the line
  you don't need <br />
  (`@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb` or `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid`) <br />
  Do not copy-paste as is, without removing the other line.
</Callout>

```javascript copy
{
  "name": "example-web-hid-usb",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "source": "src/index.html",
  "dependencies": {
    "@ledgerhq/hw-app-btc": "^6.12.1",
    "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid": "^6.11.2",
    "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb": "^6.11.2",
    "@ledgerhq/logs": "^6.10.0",
    "core-js": "^3.20.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "parcel build",
    "start": "parcel --https"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

The browser will warn that the website is malicious, to continue, click on "advanced settings" and then on "continue to the localhost site". Now you can test to connect your Nano on your Android.
