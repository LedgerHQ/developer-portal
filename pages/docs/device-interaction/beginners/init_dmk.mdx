# Setting up the DMK

The core package exposes a builder `DeviceManagementKitBuilder` which will be used to initialise the DMK with your configuration.

For now it allows you to add one or more custom loggers and transports.

In the following example, we add a console logger (`.addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())`), then the WebHID transport (`.addTransport(webHidTransportFactory)`).
Then we build the DMK with `.build()`.

**The returned object will be the entrypoint for all your interactions with the DMK. You should keep it as a <u>SINGLETON</u>.**

The DMK should be built only once in your application runtime so keep a reference of this object somewhere.

```ts
import {
  ConsoleLogger,
  DeviceManagementKitBuilder,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";
import { webHidTransportFactory } from "@ledgerhq/device-transport-kit-web-hid";

export const dmk = new DeviceManagementKitBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
  .addTransport(webHidTransportFactory)
  .build();
```
