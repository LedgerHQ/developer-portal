# Setting up the SDK

The core package exposes an SDK builder `DeviceSdkBuilder` which will be used to initialise the SDK with your configuration.

For now it allows you to add one or more custom loggers.

In the following example, we add a console logger (`.addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())`). Then we build the SDK with `.build()`.

**The returned object will be the entrypoint for all your interactions with the SDK. You should keep it as a <u>SINGLETON</u>.**

The SDK should be built only once in your application runtime so keep a reference of this object somewhere.

```ts
import {
  ConsoleLogger,
  DeviceSdk,
  DeviceSdkBuilder,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";

export const sdk = new DeviceSdkBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
  .build();
```
