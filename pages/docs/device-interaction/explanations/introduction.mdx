# Why Device Management Kit ?

The DMK is a set of tools and libraries that allow you to manage your devices in a secure and efficient way. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Device Signer Kit, which is a set of tools and libraries that allow you to sign transactions securely.

It has been designed for external developers with the main idea to provide the best experience for developers to interact with Ledger devices.

It should as maximum as possible abstract the complexity of the communication with the device and provide a simple and easy-to-use API.

It tends to be a replacement for the LedgerJS libraries, mainly `hw-app-XXX` and `transport-XXX` libraries. These libraries are intended to be deprecated in the future.
