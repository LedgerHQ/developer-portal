# Signer Kits

As ledger devices are able to install applications that will allow to be compatible with different blockchains,
we have created these kits.

Each **signer kit** is coming along with a Ledger Embedded App (ex: _signer-kit-eth_ is coming with _ledger app ethereum_ ).

The main goal of each signer is to ease interaction with the app in the most seamless way possible.

## Available Signers

- [Signer Bitcoin](./signers/btc)
- [Signer Ethereum](./signers/eth)
- [Signer Solana](./signers/solana)
