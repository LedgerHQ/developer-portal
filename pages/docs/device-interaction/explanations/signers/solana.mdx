# Solana Signer Kit

## Features

Following doc is matching for v1.0.0 of the Ethereum Signer Kit.

### 1: Get Address

This method allows users to retrieve the Solana address according to given `derivationPath`.

```typescript
const { observable, cancel } = signerSolana.getAddress(derivationPath, options);
```

**Parameters**

- `derivationPath`

  - **Required**
  - **Type:** `string` (e.g., `"44'/501'/0'"`)
  - The derivation path used for the Solana address. See [here](https://www.ledger.com/blog/understanding-crypto-addresses-and-derivation-paths) for more information.

- `options`

  - Optional
  - Type: `AddressOptions`

    ```typescript
    type AddressOptions = {
      checkOnDevice?: boolean;
    };
    ```

  - `checkOnDevice`: An optional boolean indicating whether user confirmation on the device is required (`true`) or not (`false`).

**Returns**

- `observable`

  - An [Observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) object that contains the [`DeviceActionState`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/device-sdk-ts/blob/develop/packages/device-management-kit/src/api/device-action/model/DeviceActionState.ts) derived instance, which reprensents the operation's state. For example:

    ```typescript
    observable.subscribe({
      next: (state: DeviceActionState) => {
        switch (state.status) {
          case DeviceActionStatus.NotStarted: {
            console.log("The action is not started yet.");
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Pending: {
            const {
              intermediateValue: { requiredUserInteraction },
            } = state;
            // Access the intermediate value here, explained below
            console.log(
              "The action is pending and the intermediate value is: ",
              intermediateValue,
            );
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Stopped: {
            console.log("The action has been stopped.");
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Completed: {
            const { output } = state;
            // Access the output of the completed action here
            console.log("The action has been completed: ", output);
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Error: {
            const { error } = state;
            // Access the error here if occured
            console.log("An error occured during the action: ", error);
            break;
          }
        }
      },
    });
    ```

  - When the action status is `DeviceActionStatus.Pending`, the state will include an `intermediateValue` object that provides useful information for interaction:

    ```typescript
    const { requiredUserInteraction } = intermediateValue;

    switch (requiredUserInteraction) {
      case UserInteractionRequired.VerifyAddress: {
        // User needs to verify the address displayed on the device
        console.log(
          "User needs to verify the address displayed on the device.",
        );
        break;
      }
      case UserInteractionRequired.None: {
        // No user action required
        console.log("No user action needed.");
        break;
      }
      case UserInteractionRequired.UnlockDevice: {
        // User needs to unlock the device
        console.log("The user needs to unlock the device.");
        break;
      }
      case UserInteractionRequired.ConfirmOpenApp: {
        // User needs to confirm on the device to open the app
        console.log("The user needs to confirm on the device to open the app.");
        break;
      }
      default:
        // Type guard to ensure all cases are handled
        const uncaughtUserInteraction: never = requiredUserInteraction;
        console.error(
          "Unhandled user interaction case:",
          uncaughtUserInteraction,
        );
    }
    ```

  - When the action status is `DeviceActionStatus.Completed`, the execution result can be accessed through the `output` property in the state. The `output` property is of type `PublicKey` in `base58`.

    ```typescript
    type PublicKey = string; // address in base58 format
    ```

- `cancel`
  - The function without a return value to cancel the action on the Ledger device.

### 2: Sign Transaction

This method enables users to securely sign transactions using clear signing on Ledger devices.

```typescript
const { observable, cancel } = signerSolana.signTransaction(
  derivationPath,
  transaction,
  options,
);
```

**Parameters**

- `derivationPath`

  - **Required**
  - **Type:** `string` (e.g., `"44'/501'/0'"`)
  - The derivation path used in the transaction. See [here](https://www.ledger.com/blog/understanding-crypto-addresses-and-derivation-paths) for more information.

- `transaction`

  - **Required**
  - **Type:** `Uint8Array`
  - The transaction object that needs to be signed.

- `options`

  - **Optional**
  - **Type:** `TBD`
  - No option defined yet, but will be used for clear signing in a near future.

    ```typescript
    type TransactionOptions = {};
    ```

**Returns**

- `observable`

  - An [Observable](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) object that contains the [`DeviceActionState`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/device-sdk-ts/blob/develop/packages/device-management-kit/src/api/device-action/model/DeviceActionState.ts) derived instance which reprensents the operation's state. For example:

    ```typescript
    observable.subscribe({
      next: (state: SignTransactionDAState) => {
        switch (state.status) {
          case DeviceActionStatus.NotStarted: {
            console.log("The action is not started yet.");
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Pending: {
            const {
              intermediateValue: { requiredUserInteraction },
            } = state;
            // Access the intermediate value here, explained below
            console.log(
              "The action is pending and the intermediate value is: ",
              intermediateValue,
            );
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Stopped: {
            console.log("The action has been stopped.");
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Completed: {
            const { output } = state;
            // Access the output of the completed action here
            console.log("The action has been completed: ", output);
            break;
          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Error: {
            const { error } = state;
            // Access the error here if occured
            console.log("An error occured during the action: ", error);
            break;
          }
        }
      },
    });
    ```

  - When the action status is `DeviceActionStatus.Pending`, the state will include an `intermediateValue` object that provides useful information for interaction:

    ```typescript
    const { requiredUserInteraction } = intermediateValue;

    switch (requiredUserInteraction) {
      case UserInteractionRequired.SignTransaction: {
        // User needs to sign the transaction displayed on the device
        console.log(
          "User needs to sign the transaction displayed on the device.",
        );
        break;
      }
      case UserInteractionRequired.None: {
        // No user action required
        console.log("No user action needed.");
        break;
      }
      case UserInteractionRequired.UnlockDevice: {
        // User needs to unlock the device
        console.log("The user needs to unlock the device.");
        break;
      }
      case UserInteractionRequired.ConfirmOpenApp: {
        // User needs to confirm on the device to open the app
        console.log("The user needs to confirm on the device to open the app.");
        break;
      }
      default:
        // Type guard to ensure all cases are handled
        const uncaughtUserInteraction: never = requiredUserInteraction;
        console.error(
          "Unhandled user interaction case:",
          uncaughtUserInteraction,
        );
    }
    ```

  - When the action status is `DeviceActionStatus.Completed`, the execution result can be accessed through the `output` property in the state. This property is a `Signature` object with the following structure:

    ```typescript
    type Signature = Uint8Array;
    ```

      next: (state: SignPersonalMessageDAState) => {
        switch (state.status) {
          case DeviceActionStatus.NotStarted: {

          }
          case DeviceActionStatus.Error: {
            const { error } = state;
            // Access the error here if occured
            console.log("An error occured during the action: ", error);
            break;
          }
        }
      },
    });

## Example

We encourage you to explore the Solana Signer by trying it out in our online [sample application](https://app.devicesdk.ledger-test.com/). Experience how it works and see its capabilities in action. Of course, you will need a Ledger device connected.
