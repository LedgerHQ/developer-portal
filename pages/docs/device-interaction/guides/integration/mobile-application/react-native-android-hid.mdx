# React Native HID (Android only)

## Introduction
In this section, you will see how to create a React Native application using the [@ledgerhq/react-native-hid](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/react-native-hid) (Only on Android).
For this project some general prerequisites are mandatory and you can find them [here](../).

Then you can now go through the prerequisite for Android development below.

## One-time setup

### Environnement

Make sure you go through:   
1. the [Development Prerequisites](../../integration-walkthrough).
1. the [Mobile Environment Setup](environment-setup).

### Environnement variables
If you are using bash, put the environment variable into the bash_profile as below:

```console copy
cd ~/
touch ~/.bash_profile;
open -e .bash_profile
```

```console copy
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Do the same if you are using zsh or anything else. Remember the file will be named differently (eg. zsh => .zprofile)

## App Coding

Now that we have set up the prerequisites, you can now create the application.
In this integration, we will use the ethereum application.

### App setup
First, open a terminal and create a new project. For this tutorial the project will be named “myAndroidHidApp”.

Run:

```console copy
react-native init myAndroidHidApp
cd myAndroidHidApp
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The dependencies of 'CocoaPods' may take some time to initialize.
</Callout>

### Files

Run:

```console copy
touch App.js
touch polyfill.js
```
Open your folder in a code editor, it must look like this.

<br/>
<div className="center">
  <figure>
    <img src="/connectivity/folder-rn-android.png" alt="Folder of the Application"/>
    <figcaption><i>Fig. 4: Folder of the Application</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

#### polyfill.js

In "polyfill.js", copy-paste the following code:

```javascript copy
global.Buffer = require("buffer").Buffer;
```

#### index.js

Then import the "polyfill.js" in "index.js" as shown below:

```javascript copy
/**
 * @format
 */

import "./polyfill";    //import this
import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from './App';
import {name as appName} from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

#### App.js

In App.js copy-paste the following code:

```javascript copy
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import { listen } from "@ledgerhq/logs";

import TransportHID from "@ledgerhq/react-native-hid";
import AppEth from "@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth";


// This is helpful if you want to see BLE logs. (only to use in dev mode)

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    transport: null
  };

  onSelectDevice = async () => {
    try {
      const transport = await TransportHID.create();
      listen(log => console.log(log));
      const eth = new AppEth(transport);
      const path = "44'/60'/0'/0/0"; // HD derivation path
      const { address } = await eth.getAddress(path, false);
      this.setState({ transport: address });
      await eth.getAddress(path, true);
    } catch (e) {
      throw new Error(e);
      return null;
    }
  };

  render() {
    const { transport } = this.state;
     if(!transport){
       return (
        <View style={styles.header}>
          <Text style={styles.headerTitle}>Scanning for Ledger...</Text>
          <Text style={styles.headerSubtitle} onPress={() => {this.onSelectDevice()}}>
            Power up your Ledger and enter your pin. Then tap the screen
          </Text>
        </View>
      );
    }else{
      return (<View style={styles.header}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Ledger Live Ethereum Account 1</Text>
        <Text style={styles.headerTitle}>
          {transport}
        </Text>
      </View>
      );
    }
  };
}

export default App;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  header: {
    paddingTop: 80,
    paddingBottom: 36,
    alignItems: "center"
  },
  headerTitle: {
    fontSize: 22,
    marginBottom: 16
  },
  headerSubtitle: {
    fontSize: 12,
    color: "#999"
  },
  list: {
    flex: 1
  },
  errorTitle: {
    color: "#c00",
    fontSize: 16,
    marginBottom: 16
  }
});

```
### Dependencies

#### Installation

Run:

```console copy
npm install --save buffer
npm install --save @ledgerhq/logs
npm install --save @ledgerhq/hw-app-eth
npm install --save @ledgerhq/hw-transport-webusb
```

| Package | What it does |
|---------|------------------|
|[buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer) | The goal is to provide an API that is 100% identical to node's Buffer API. |
|[@ledgerhq/logs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/logs) | It helps you ask your Ledger device to access the ethereum address. |
|[rxjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxjs) | It is a rewrite of "Reactive-Extensions/RxJS" and is the latest production-ready version of RxJS. |
|[@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-app-eth) | It helps you ask your Ledger device to access the ethereum address.|
| [@ledgerhq/react-native-hid](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/react-native-hid) |It provides you with all the methods to interact with  your Ledger with an HID connexion. |

#### package.json

Now that the dependencies are installed you can find them in the “package.js”.
This is how your “package.json” must look like.

```javascript copy
{
  "name": "myAndroidHidApp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "android": "react-native run-android",
    "ios": "react-native run-ios",
    "start": "react-native start",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth": "^6.15.2",
    "@ledgerhq/logs": "^6.10.0",
    "@ledgerhq/react-native-hid": "^6.11.2",
    "buffer": "^6.0.3",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-native": "0.66.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.16.0",
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.16.3",
    "@react-native-community/eslint-config": "^3.0.1",
    "babel-jest": "^27.3.1",
    "eslint": "^8.3.0",
    "jest": "^27.3.1",
    "metro-react-native-babel-preset": "^0.66.2",
    "react-test-renderer": "17.0.2"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "react-native"
  }
}
```
#### Build.gradle Modification
In “build.gradle”, in the "android" folder change `minSdkVersion = 21` to `minSdkVersion = 24`.

![Build.gradle Modify the minSdkVersion](/connectivity/change-minSDK.png)
*Fig. 5: Build.gradle Modify the minSdkVersion*


You can now test the application you have built.

## App Launch

App testing is done on your smartphone because the Android Studio emulator cannot use Bluetooth or USB connexions.

<Callout>
  Please refer to the information for [Android Emulator Limitation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22604305/how-to-use-android-emulator-for-testing-bluetooth-application).
</Callout>

### Enable Developer Settings
To integrate an application on your Android smartphone you have to enable the developer role.
To do that go to  Settings > About Phone > Build Number, and tap 7 times on build number to enable the developer settings.

Then go to Settings > System > Advanced > Developer Options and enable the  "USB debugging" as well as "Install via USB"

Connect your phone to your computer, and run the command below to check your device is connected:
```console copy
adb devices
```
If all goes well, the list of devices is displayed as shown below:

    <figcaption><i>Fig. 6: Device Connected On The Machine</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<Callout>
  For more information about enabling the developer settings on your android device go to [android studio docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
</Callout>

### Start the Development Server
You can now open a terminal, go to the "myAndroidHidApp" folder, and start the server by running:
```console copy
npm start
```

### Install the App on Device
Keep the terminal where "metro" is running open and open a new terminal.
In this new terminal go to your app folder:
```console copy
cd myAndroidHidApp
```

Run the command  below to install the application on your android device. It assumes your smartphone is connected and your device is recognized by the command `adb devices` as mentioned in the [Previous Step](#enable-developer-settings).
```console copy
npm run android
```

A window will pop up on your android device to install the application. Click on "Yes" to install it and run it.

### Launching the App
When launching the application it will be displayed as the image below.
