# Secure Channel

The secure connection is established between the connected device and Ledger HSM backend service via WebSocket. The following device actions will be executed with the secure connection.

1. **Genuine Check Device Action**: Verifies the genuineness of the connected device.
2. **List Installed Apps Device Action**: Lists all installed applications on the device.
3. **Install App Device Action**: Installs a specified application on the device by name.
4. **Uninstall App Device Action**: Uninstalls a specified application from the device name.

All device actions below may require a specific user interaction(`AllowSecureConnection`) during execution. However, this interaction is only requested **once per device reboot**.

## ðŸ”¹ Device Actions

### Genuine Check Device Action

This device action checks the genuineness of the connected device. It returns `true` if the device is genuine, and `false` otherwise. This step is typically performed first to ensure the device's integrity before executing other operations.

#### **Input**

- `unlockTimeout`
  - Optional
  - Type: `number`
  - The maximum waiting time for the user to unlock the device

#### **Output**

- `isGenuine`
  - **Type**: `boolean`
  - The result indicates whether the device is genuine

#### **Intermediate Value**

- `requiredUserInteraction`
  - **Type**: `UserInteractionRequired`
  - The user interactions that are required during the execution of the device action.

```typescript
import {
  GenuineCheckDeviceAction,
  GenuineCheckDAState,
  DeviceActionStatus,
  UserInteractionRequired,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";

const deviceAction = new GenuineCheckDeviceAction({
  input: { unlockTimeout: 60000 },
});

const { observable, cancel } = await dmk.executeDeviceAction({
  deviceAction,
});

observable.subscribe({
  next: (state: GenuineCheckDAState) => {
    switch (state.status) {
      case DeviceActionStatus.Pending:
        const {
          intermediateValue: { requiredUserInteraction },
        } = state;
        switch (requiredUserInteraction) {
          case UserInteractionRequired.None:
            console.log("No user action required");
            break;
          case UserInteractionRequired.AllowSecureConnection:
            console.log(
              "User should allow the secure connection on the device",
            );
            break;
          case UserInteractionRequired.UnlockDevice:
            console.log("User should unlock the device");
            break;
          default:
            throw new Error("Unknown user interaction required");
        }
        break;
      case DeviceActionStatus.Completed:
        const { output } = state;
        console.log("Device action completed", output);
        break;
      case DeviceActionStatus.Error:
        const { error } = state;
        console.log("Error occurred during the execution", error);
        break;
    }
  },
});
```

### List Installed Apps Device Action

This device action retrieves a list of all applications currently installed on the connected device. It will **not** request the `AllowListApps` user permission to execute.

#### **Input**

- `unlockTimeout`
  - Optional
  - Type: `number`
  - The maximum waiting time for the user to unlock the device.

#### **Output**

- `installedApps`
  - **Type**: `Array<InstalledApp>`
  - All installed apps on the connected device.

#### **Intermediate Value**

- `requiredUserInteraction`
  - **Type**: `UserInteractionRequired`
  - The user interactions that are required during the execution of the device action.

```typescript
import {
  DeviceActionStatus,
  UserInteractionRequired,
  ListInstalledAppsDeviceAction,
  ListInstalledAppsDAState,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";

const deviceAction = new ListInstalledAppsDeviceAction({
  input: { unlockTimeout: 60000 },
});

const { observable, cancel } = await dmk.executeDeviceAction({
  deviceAction,
});

observable.subscribe({
  next: (state: ListInstalledAppsDAState) => {
    switch (state.status) {
      case DeviceActionStatus.Pending:
        const {
          intermediateValue: { requiredUserInteraction },
        } = state;
        switch (requiredUserInteraction) {
          case UserInteractionRequired.None:
            console.log("No user action required");
            break;
          case UserInteractionRequired.AllowSecureConnection:
            console.log(
              "User should allow the secure connection on the device",
            );
            break;
          case UserInteractionRequired.UnlockDevice:
            console.log("User should unlock the device");
            break;
