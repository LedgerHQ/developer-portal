# Migration from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0

We made some breaking changes to the Device Management Kit in 0.6 which are detailed below.

## Transports

The transports implementation have been moved to their own packages.

- `@ledgerhq/device-transport-kit-web-hid`
- `@ledgerhq/device-transport-kit-web-ble`

To use a transport, you need to install the corresponding package and inject it in the DeviceManagementKit.

**0.5**

Transports were built-in the DeviceManagementKit.

```typescript
import {
  DeviceManagementKitBuilder,
  ConsoleLogger,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";

const dmk = new DeviceManagementKitBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
  .build();
```

**0.6**

In 0.6, you need to manually inject the transport you want to use.

```typescript
import {
  DeviceManagementKitBuilder,
  ConsoleLogger,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";
import { webHidTransportFactory } from "@ledgerhq/device-transport-kit-web-hid";

const dmk = new DeviceManagementKitBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
  .addTransport(webHidTransportFactory)
  .build();
```

```diff
import { DeviceManagementKitBuilder, ConsoleLogger } from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";
+ import { webHidTransportFactory } from "@ledgerhq/device-transport-kit-web-hid";

const dmk = new DeviceManagementKitBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
+ .addTransport(webHidTransportFactory)
  .build();
```
