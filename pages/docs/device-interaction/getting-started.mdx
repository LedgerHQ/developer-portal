# Getting started

In this section of the Developer Portal, you will find the resources to add the support of Ledger devices in a web, desktop, or mobile app.

## Tools and boilerplates

- To play with our transport librairies and get fimiliar with our tools, we recommend you go through our beginners' guides. 
- To start developing your project go to the integration walkthroughs and pick your platform.

## Languages

| Type of App |  Required skills |
|-------------|------------------|
| Web App     | JavaScript       | 
| Mobile App  | React Native     |
| Desktop App | Electron/Node.js |

## Prerequisites


### Summary

To connect your app you will need to install:
- [Node (for Desktop apps) and NPM](#node-and-npm)
- [Ledger Live](#ledger-live-installation)
- [The Ledger Embedded App](#embedded-app-installation) of the coin that you are going to use (to use this documentation you will need Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana)
- At least [one account](#account-creation) for each coin (except for Solana).

### Node and NPM

If not already installed, install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node & npm</a>, choose the LTS version of your operating system. You can check if you have it installed by checking the version with the following commands:

```
$ node -v
v20.9.0

$ npm -v
10.5.0
```

The commands should print the versions of Node.js and npm accordingly. Ensure Node.JS is 20.9.0. 

---------------------------------
### Ledger Live Installation

Now that node and npm are installed, you have to install the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) desktop application to connect your Ledger device.
After the installation, open Ledger Live and go to the **Manager** tab.

### Embedded App Installation

Now you can install the Ethereum and bitcoin application into your Ledger Nano S/X/S Plus, as in the tutorials and walkthroughs, we will use the Ethereum and Bitcoin application.

### Account Creation

To use the Bitcoin/Ethereum Embedded Apps you have to create a Bitcoin/Ethereum account.
We will present there the creation of a bitcoin account but it is the same for any application supported by Ledger Live.


To create your Bitcoin account:

- Launch the Bitcoin application on your Ledger Nano S/X/S Plus

- Open the Bitcoin app on your ledger device
