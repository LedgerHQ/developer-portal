<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This project is still in early development so we allow ourselves to make
  breaking changes regarding the usage of the Libraries.

That's why any feedback is relevant for us in order to be able to make it stable as soon as
possible. Get in touch with us on the [Ledger Discord
server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to provide your feedbacks.

You can follow the migration guidelines for the DMK [here](./integration/migrations/dmk/05_to_06) and for the signers [here](./integration/migrations/signers/eth/1_1_0_to_1_2_0).
