# What are Device Signer Kits?

As ledger devices are able to install applications that will allow to be compatible with different blockchains, we have created Device Signer Kits.

Each **signer kit** is coming along with a Ledger Embedded App (ex: _signer-kit-eth_ is coming with _ledger app ethereum_ ).

The main goal of each signer is to ease interaction with the app in the most seamless way possible.
