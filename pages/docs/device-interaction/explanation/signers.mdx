# What are Device Signer Kits?

Device Signer Kits are designed to facilitate seamless interactions with Ledger devices across various blockchain applications. As Ledger devices can support multiple blockchain technologies through the installation of specific applications, Device Signer Kits provide the necessary tools to efficiently manage these interactions.

## Purpose of Device Signer Kits

Each Device Signer Kit is paired with a corresponding Ledger Embedded App, enabling compatibility with specific blockchains. For example, the `signer-kit-eth` is used in conjunction with the Ledger Ethereum app, ensuring that developers can interact with Ethereum blockchain functionalities directly through their Ledger devices.
The primary objective of each signer kit is to streamline communication with the Ledger device's applications. By abstracting the complexities of blockchain integration, these kits offer a user-friendly API that allows developers to focus on building their blockchain applications without worrying about the intricacies of device communication.

## Available Signers

- **Ethereum Signer**
- **Solana Signer**
- **Bitcoin Signer**

By utilizing Device Signer Kits, developers gain access to a set of comprehensive tools that simplify the process of managing blockchain interactions on Ledger devices, promoting efficient and secure application development.
