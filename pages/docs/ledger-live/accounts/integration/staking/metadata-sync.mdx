# Account sync

As this feature isn’t supported everywhere, we are going to extend account metadata like this :

```ts copy
export type MyBlockchainResources = {
  delegations: MyBlockchainDelegation[];
  unbondings: MyBlockchainUnbonding[];
  delegatedBalance: BigNumber;
  pendingRewardsBalance: BigNumber;
  unbondingBalance: BigNumber;
};
```

This is what will act as a cache of account staking informations

As every account related sync, it is done in the sync method of the account bridge. It’s the same as a standard send/receive integration, except we fetch addition staking data, and return additional resources:

```ts copy
return {
   ...
   myBlockchainResources: {
   delegations,
   unbondings,
   delegatedBalance,
   pendingRewardsBalance,
   unbondingBalance,
   },
 };
```

Those informations need to be serialized when saving app cache

We need to update those bridge methods:

- `assignFromAccountRaw`

- `assignToAccountRaw`

They are required when we start using specific additional account resources (here, myBlockchainResources)
