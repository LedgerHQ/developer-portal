# Implementation strategy

We can divide this feature in following steps :

- [Synchronizing current staking information](./metadata-sync)
- [Showing to the user those informations](./account)
- [Fetching validator list so the user can delegate to them](./validators)
- [Crafting right transactions](./crafting)
- [Implementing staking actions in modals - flows](./flows)
- [Managing more tx types in history](./history)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  There is sadly no coin-framework ready way to handle staking currently, so it
  relies on UI modularization for now (eg. overriding / implementing custom
  components)
</Callout>
