# Exchange SDK

### Update dependency versions

Open `lib/package.json` and update `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client` and `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-exchange-module` version that support the new coin.

<b>Note</b>: `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-exchange-module` has nightly releases, you
might need to use it in order to proceed with swap tests, given that a proper
version of the package is released only with every release of ledger-live.

<b>Note 2</b>: don’t forget to update the `peerDependencies` in `package.json`.

---

```sh copy
pnpm update @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-client@latest
```

```sh copy
pnpm update @ledgerhq/wallet-api-exchange-module@latest
```

### Add “new-coin” to transaction strategy

Open `lib/src/wallet-api.ts` and add the “new-coin” transaction method to the transaction strategy object.

### Release a new version of ExchangeSDK

Once PR is merged into main, you can ask for a Release.

Once the new version of exchange-sdk is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/exchange-sdk?activeTab=versions), it can be updated in the SwapLiveApp.
