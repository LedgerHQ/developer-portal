# Implementation strategy

## Update cryptoassets

[First, we need to add your currency](./cryptoassets-library), this is where we tell Ledger Live :

- The name of the currency
- Which nano app is needed for this currency
- Which blockchain family handles the currency
- Transaction explorer links
- Units / Tickers (ex: satoshi vs btc magnitude)
- Derivation info (derivation path parts : coin type, ...)
- Color of the chain

## Device app library

We'll implement a [library to abstract the communication layer with the device app](./js-bindings), through javascript methods instead of using transport directly.

## Initiate coin-module using boilerplate

Coin-module abstract the same way blockchain specific logic in Ledger Live, you can use our [boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/coin-modules/coin-module-boilerplate)

## Instantiate coin-module in ledger-live-common

Once coin module is ready and tested through unit and integration tests, we can instantiate it in ledger-live-common with the signer via two steps:

- [Light sync](./light-sync)
- [Full sync](./full-sync)

## Implement Alpaca API

Finally, once your integration works well, we can make it [compatible with Ledger enterprise solution](./alpaca)
