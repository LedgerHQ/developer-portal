# Using the `testBridge` utility

## Write the bridge.integration.test.ts

Any test that requires HTTP to work should be moved in an integration test using the file name convention `.integration.test.ts`. In the case of testing a coin integration, we usually name that file `bridge.integration.test.ts` and we recommend to use the `testBridge` utility.

The `testBridge` utility takes a "DatasetTest" as a parameter which will conduct many kind of integration tests.

First, create a `bridge.integration.test.ts` file and fill it with this empty template:

```ts copy
import "../../__tests__/test-helpers/setup";
import { testBridge } from "../../__tests__/test-helpers/bridge";
import type { DatasetTest } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";

const dataset: DatasetTest<Transaction> = {
  implementations: ["js"],
  currencies: {
    mycoin: {},
  },
};
```

You can also generate it with a Ledger device, with a seed that you want to freeze (meaning you don't want to do anymore transaction with that seed, or you will need to regenerate the snapshot everytime) and execute in the CLI the command:

```sh copy
pnpm run:cli generateTestScanAccounts -c mycoin
```

The expected output is:

```ts copy
import "../../__tests__/test-helpers/setup";
import { testBridge } from "../../__tests__/test-helpers/bridge";
import type { CurrenciesData } from "../../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "../types";

const dataset: CurrenciesData<Transaction> = {
  scanAccounts: [
    {
      name: "mycoin seed 1",
      apdus: `
      => 100112344221c00002200000000000000000000000
      <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
      => 100112344221c00002200000800000008000000080
      <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
      => 100112344221c00002210000800000008000000080
      <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
      => 100112344221c00002220000800000008000000080
      <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
      => 100112344221c00002230000800000008000000080
      `,
    },
  ],
};

testBridge(dataset);
```

Just keep the part with the scanAccounts and put it the `mycoin` part :

```ts copy
import "../../__tests__/test-helpers/setup";
import { testBridge } from "../../__tests__/test-helpers/bridge";
import type { DatasetTest } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";

const dataset: DatasetTest<Transaction> = {
  implementations: ["js"],
  currencies: {
    mycoin: {
      scanAccounts: [
        {
          name: "mycoin seed 1",
          apdus: `
            => 100112344221c00002200000000000000000000000
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002200000800000008000000080
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002210000800000008000000080
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002220000800000008000000080
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002230000800000008000000080
            `,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};

testBridge(dataset);
```

Then, get info on the accounts that you want to freeze, they will be used as references for our tests.
It should look something like this:

```ts copy
import "../../__tests__/test-helpers/setup";
import { testBridge } from "../../__tests__/test-helpers/bridge";
import type { DatasetTest } from "../../types";
import type { Transaction } from "./types";

const dataset: DatasetTest<Transaction> = {
  implementations: ["js"],
  currencies: {
    mycoin: {
      scanAccounts: [
        {
          name: "mycoin seed 1",
          apdus: `
            => 100112344221c00002200000000000000000000000
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002200000800000008000000080
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002210000800000008000000080
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002220000800000008000000080
            <= 213321ac21234122100000000000000000
            => 100112344221c00002230000800000008000000080
            `,
        },
      ],
      accounts: [
        {
          raw: {
            id: `js:2:mycoin:ADDR:`,
            seedIdentifier: ADDR,
            name: "MyCoin 1",
            derivationMode: "",
            index: 0,
            freshAddress: ADDR,
            freshAddressPath: "44'/354'/0'/0/0'",
            freshAddresses: [],
            blockHeight: 0,
            operations: [],
            pendingOperations: [],
            currencyId: "mycoin",
            unitMagnitude: 10,
            lastSyncDate: "",
            balance: "2111000",
          },
          transactions: [
            // HERE WE WILL INSERT OUR test
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};

testBridge(dataset);
```

The `accounts` part is manual. This allow you to chose the best parameters for the situation you want to test.

### Use regular Jest tests if you need more flexibility

We tried to cover as many cases as possible that are in `getTransactionStatus`.

You are free to define your own extra tests in `bridge.integration.test.ts` (or any other integration test file) for more advanced tests that would not be covered by the bridge generic tests.

### Launch the test

To launch the test do:

```bash copy
pnpm common jest --runTestsByPath src/families/<mycoin>/bridge.integration.test.ts 
```

Replace `<mycoin>` with the name of your coin.


### How does a test work?

The transaction tests simulate an object `Transaction` as input, and a `TransactionStatus` as an output that we compare with an expected status.

There's some generic tests that are already made in `src/__tests__/test-helpers/bridge.ts` that are mandatory to pass.

To implement your own test in `test-dataset.ts`, add an Object typed like this in the array of `transactions`:

```ts copy
import Transaction from "./types";

type TestTransaction = {
  name: string;
  transaction: Transaction;
  expectedStatus: {
    amount: BigNumber;
    errors: {};
    warnings: {};
  };
};
```

This `TestTransaction` uses as mainAccount the account that we have set before and then execute the command `getTransactionStatus` by using the `transaction` object as input.
