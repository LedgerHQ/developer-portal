# 7 - Ledger Live Desktop and Mobile

1. Fork [github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live)
2. Clone the repo

## Ledger Live Common

Ledger Live Common is the repo where all the common logic and setup (between desktop and mobile) is done.

Even if CoinModules are made with <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> as first class citizen user, it is not the only Ledger product that relies on.
Therefore, some setup is required to allow LLD and LLM to use your CoinModule.

For a dedicated CoinModule (i.e. MyCoin), all those setup files will be in `libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/mycoin` directory.

### Setup

The setup file (`libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/mycoin/setup.ts`) is responsible for the instanciation of the CoinModule.
It injects all required elements.

Some helpers function exist in LLC (`libs/ledger-live-common/src/bridge/setup.ts`), to avoid too much boilerplate.

```ts copy
import {
  MyCoinAccount,
  TransactionStatus,
  createBridges,
  type <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary>,
} from "@ledgerhq/coin-mycoin";
import { getCryptoCurrencyById } from "@ledgerhq/cryptoassets/currencies";
import Transport from "@ledgerhq/hw-transport";
import MyCoin from "@ledgerhq/hw-app-mycoin";
import type { Bridge } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import { MyCoinCoinConfig } from "@ledgerhq/coin-mycoin/config";
import myCoinResolver from "@ledgerhq/coin-mycoin/signer/index";
import makeCliTools, { type CliTools } from "@ledgerhq/coin-mycoin/test/cli";
import { createResolver, executeWithSigner, type CreateSigner } from "../../bridge/setup";
import { Resolver } from "../../hw/getAddress/types";
import { getCurrencyConfiguration } from "../../config";

const createSigner: CreateSigner<MyCoin> = (transport: Transport) => {
  return new MyCoin(transport);
};

const myCoin = getCryptoCurrencyById("myCoin");
// Closure that will load dynamically the current config linked to this coin. The config may change during LLD and LLM lifecyle.
const getCurrencyConfig = (): MyCoinCoinConfig => getCurrencyConfiguration(myCoin);

const bridge: Bridge<Transaction, MyCoinAccount, TransactionStatus> = createBridges(
  executeWithSigner(createSigner),
  getCurrencyConfig,
);

const resolver: Resolver = createResolver(createSigner, myCoinResolver);

const cliTools: CliTools = makeCliTools();

export { bridge, cliTools, resolver };

```

### Config

Ledger Live use a dynamic configuration for some parts of its logic. CoinModules use this tool to seamlessly update some key elements.

The `status` element of the following object is mandatory. The other properties are depending on your needs in the CoinModule.
`libs/ledger-live-common/src/bridge/config.ts`:

```ts copy
import { ConfigInfo } from "@ledgerhq/live-config/LiveConfig";
import { getEnv } from "@ledgerhq/live-env";

export const myCoinConfig: Record<string, ConfigInfo> = {
  config_currency_mycoin: {
    type: "object",
    default: {
      status: {
        type: "active",
      },
      node: {
        url: getEnv("API_MYCOIN_NODE"),
      },
    },
  },
};

```

## Ledger Live Desktop

### Adding the crypto in LLD

1. In  `live-common-set-supported-currencies.js` add the name you gave in the table. E.g., `mycoin`
2. Add the error translation keys in `static/i18n/en`.

### Running the Desktop project

```sh copy
cd ledger-live
pnpm dev:lld
```

## Ledger Live Mobile

### Adding the crypto in LLM

1. Similarly step as for instructions for LLD, except it is in file `live-common-setup.js`.
2. Add the error translation keys in  `src/locales/en/common.json`

### Running the Mobile project on iOS (Mac only)

The prerequisites to running the project are found in the README file.

```sh copy
cd ledger-live
pnpm dev:llm
```

### Running the Mobile project on Android or iOS

#### Android

```sh copy
pnpm mobile android
```
or open `android/` in Android Studio.

#### iOS

```sh copy
pnpm mobile ios
```
or open `ios/ledgerlivemobile.xcworkspace`
