# 4 - Add accounts: light sync

## Types

Generic types can be found in [ledgerjs/packages/types-live](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/types-live), with some documentation.

### Account

An account represents a wallet where a user detains <Glossary word="crypto assets"></Glossary> for a given crypto currency.

Ledger Live model is essentially an array of `Account` because many accounts can be created, even within a same crypto currency.

More technically, an account is a view of the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> in the context of a specific user. While <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> tracks the series of transactions, assets motions that happen between addresses, an account essentializes that from the point of view of a user that owns a set of addresses and wants to view the associated funds they detain and be able to perform transactions with it.

Essentially what the user wants to see at the end is his balance, a historic graph, and a series of past operations that were performed. Moving from the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> to the concept of account is not necessarily trivial (in blockchains like Bitcoin, the concept of account does not exist – you don't create or destroy, this concept is a view, a lense, that we abstract for the user).

In Live Common, there are currently 2 types of accounts:

- `Account` which is a top level account associated to a `CryptoCurrency` - the "main" account.
- `TokenAccount` which is a nested level account, **inside** an Account and that is associated to a `TokenCurrency`.

They are aggregated as a single `AccountLike` type, used across <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> implementations.

We will focus only on the `Account` type as we won't cover the Token <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> in this document.

All main accounts share a common ground, that you will find defined and commented [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/types-live/src/account.ts).

If needed by the blockchain, an account can also contain coin-specific resources related to a single account, like its "nonce" or additional balances (e.g. for staking), or anything that may be displayed or used in your implementation. It's generally an additional field like `myCoinResources`. See [Family-specific types](#family-specific-types) below.

### Operation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This type is not required at light sync step and will soon be removed from this section
</Callout>

Note the wording "Operation" is used instead of "Transaction". An account does not have transactions, it has **operations**.

The same abstraction applies as for Account on top of blockchain: an Operation is a view of a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> that happened in the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> that **concerns** the contextual account. It's always in the context of an account, in other words, an operation does not exist on its own.

Most of the time, a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> yield of one operation. But in some blockchains (like Ethereum) one <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> that concerns the account associated addresses can result in 0 to N operations. A typical example is contract or token transfers (one <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> to move a token generate a token operation and a fee operation in the <Glossary word="ethereum"></Glossary> account). Another example that is possible in most blockchains is a "self" <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> yields two operations (sending out, sending in). But in fact, that's semantic, we, Ledger, have put. We could also have allowed the concept of "SELF" operation.

In short, transactions history in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> is a list of `Operation`, that are confirmed, unconfirmed or pending (not yet fetched from explorer).

They all share the same model, with an `extra` field that can store any additional data you may need to display. You will find the detailed and commented fields [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/types-live/src/operation.ts).

If <i>MyCoin</i> has specific operation fields (like `additionalField` we added for example), you will be able to display them later. They are not meant to be useful in any flow, only for UI.

If <i>MyCoin</i> uses a "nonce", then `transactionSequenceNumber` must be filled correctly, as it will be necessary for signing new transactions (and will interpreted to clear pending operations). Only outgoing <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> must have this value though.

### Operation Type

An `Operation` has a `type` which is generic string typed as `OperationType`, giving more or less the direction of the operation:

- `OUT`: A send / transfer amount transaction
- `IN`: A received / incoming amount transaction
- `FEES`: A <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> that only charges fees
- `NONE`: A <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> that does not affect balance
- `REWARD`: A claimed reward (as an outgoing <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> with fees)
- `REWARD_PAYOUT`: A received reward (as an incoming transaction)
- `SLASH`: A staking slash (with slashed amount generally)

There are more types available, existing one will have predefined icons, translations and behaviours (i.e. `getOperationAmountNumber()` in [src/operation.ts](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/ledgerjs/packages/types-live/src/operation.ts)).

<i>MyCoin</i> could have also specific operation types, if you need to add a type that is not yet implemented, add them in `libs/ledgerjs/packages/types-live/src/operation.ts`. You will later need to implement some specific code for the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> Desktop and Mobile to display them correctly.

You will be asked to add an svg for the icon of your type and a label to be translated, you can check for "OPT_IN" operation in Algorand.

In LLD :

``` copy
src/renderer/components/OperationsList/ConfirmationCheck.js
```

In LLM :
(You will need to check SVG is wrapped into our component)

``` copy
src/icons/OperationStatusIcon/index.js
```

### Transaction

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This type may not be required at light sync step.
</Callout>

In <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, the "<Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary>" is the data model that is created and updated in order to build the final blob to be signed by the device, and then broadcasted to the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>.

It is highly specific to the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> protocol, and contains any data that will need to be serialized into the transmission format of the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>. It only lives for a short period of time in the application - during which the user is choosing the parameters of its <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> before it is signed and sent to the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>, after which it will be transformed into an Operation.

Note that this Operation will be considered "pending", as it is an optimistic version of the real Operation that will appear in the account history, after being synchronized.

`Transaction` will contains any data needed to create a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> on the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>. It is created as soon as the user initiates a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> flow on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, and will be updated according to its inputs, like the amount or choosing a recipient.

It shares a common shape between all coins, to which we will add specific-fields:

- `amount: BigNumber`: amount parsed from user input - will be 0 if user use all amount
- `recipient: string`: the recipient of this amount
- `useAllAmount?: boolean`: indicated if user wants to transfer whole available balance
- `subAccountId?: ?string`: the child/token account id if relevant
- `family: string`: the coin-family of the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> (as a coin discriminator)

Some coins also have some fields generally respecting the same semantics, here are some provided as example:

- `mode: string`: type of <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> to be broadcasted (`"send"`, `"freeze"`, `"delegate"`, `"claimReward"`...)
- `fees: BigNumber`: fees (provided by <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>, or filled by user)
- `memo: ?string`: memo if required by exchange

Although some fields are required, they can be emptied (recipent = "" and amount = 0) and ignored for transactions not using them.

You should add any fields that would be required by <i>MyCoin</i> to be correctly broadcasted - respecting as much as possible its protocol's lexicon.

See existing implementations for inspiration: [Polkadot types](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/coin-modules/coin-polkadot/src/types/bridge.ts), [Cosmos types](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/cosmos/types.ts)

### Family-specific types

You will be implementing types that will be used in your <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary>, like the <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary> type or the additional data needed to be added to the Account shared type, but also any other types that you will need (remember to always type your functions with typescript).

`libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/types/bridge.ts`:

```ts copy
import type { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import type {
  TransactionCommon,
  TransactionCommonRaw,
} from "@ledgerhq/types-live";

/**
 * MyCoin account resources
 */
export type MyCoinResources = {
  nonce: number;
  additionalBalance: BigNumber;
};

/**
 * MyCoin account resources from raw JSON
 */
export type MyCoinResourcesRaw = {
  nonce: number;
  additionalBalance: string;
};

/**
 * MyCoin transaction
 */
export type <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary> = TransactionCommon & {
  mode: string;
  family: "mycoin";
  fees?: BigNumber;
  // add here all transaction-specific fields if you implement other modes than "send"
};

/**
 * MyCoin <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> from a raw JSON
 */
export type TransactionRaw = TransactionCommonRaw & {
  family: "mycoin";
  mode: string;
  fees?: string;
  // also the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> fields as raw JSON data
};

/**
 * MyCoin currency data that will be preloaded.
 * You can for instance add a list of validators for Proof-of-Stake blockchains,
 * or any volatile data that could not be set as constants in the code (staking progress, fee estimation variables, etc.)
 */
export type MyCoinPreloadData = {
  somePreloadedData: Record<any, any>;
};
```

Since some of thoses types will be serialized when stored or cached, you may need to define serialize/deserialize functions for those:

`libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/serialization.ts`:

```ts copy
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import type { MyCoinResourcesRaw, MyCoinResources } from "./types";

export function toMyCoinResourcesRaw(r: MyCoinResources): MyCoinResourcesRaw {
  const { <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary>, additionalBalance } = r;
  return {
    <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary>,
    additionalBalance: additionalBalance.toString(),
  };
}

export function fromMyCoinResourcesRaw(r: MyCoinResourcesRaw): MyCoinResources {
  const { <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary>, additionalBalance } = r;
  return {
    <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary>,
    additionalBalance: BigNumber(additionalBalance),
  };
}
```

Because of Account being generic, you may need to add your specific resources to your `libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/types/bridge.ts` file, if you need to store specific information related to the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> (like staking, validators, or frozen balance, etc) that are not handle in Account.

```ts
// ...

export type MyCoinResources = {}
export type MyCoinResourcesRaw = {}

export type Account = {
// ...
// // On some <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>, an account can have resources (gained, delegated, ...)
  myCoinResources?: MyCoinResources;
};

export type AccountRaw = {
  myCoinResources?: MyCoinResourcesRaw;
};
```

...and handle the associated serialization in `libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/serialization.ts` (if you use BigInt you will need to make it raw by changing it to string for example):

```ts copy
import { Account, AccountRaw } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import {
  toMyCoinResourcesRaw,
  fromMyCoinResourcesRaw,
} from "./types";
// ...

function toMyCoinResourcesRaw(r: MyCoinResources): MyCoinResourcesRaw {
//     ...
}
function fromMyCoinResourcesRaw(r: MyCoinResourcesRaw): MyCoinResources {
//     ...
}

export function assignToAccountRaw(account: Account, accountRaw: AccountRaw) {
  const myCoinAccount = account as MyCoinAccount;
  const myCoinAccountRaw = accountRaw as MyCoinAccountRaw;
  if (myCoinAccount.mycoinResources) {
    myCoinAccountRaw.mycoinResources = toMyCoinResourcesRaw(
      myCoinAccount.mycoinResources,
    );
  }
}
export function assignFromAccountRaw(accountRaw: AccountRaw, account: Account) {
  const myCoinResourcesRaw = (accountRaw as MyCoinAccountRaw).myCoinResources;
  if (myCoinResourcesRaw) {
    (account as MyCoinAccount).myCoinResources = fromMyCoinResourcesRaw(myCoinResourcesRaw);
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  If your <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> of <i>MyCoin</i> does not require coin-specific data in an account, you will not need to define <code>MyCoinResources</code>.
</Callout>

### Display Format

Since `Operation` will be stored as JSON, you will need to implement specific serializers for the `extra` field.

We also would like the `Operation` and `Account` to be displayed in <Glossary word="CLI"></Glossary> with their specifics, so you must provide formatters to display them.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In this code sample, all references to operations are not needed at light sync step. They are currently necessary but will soon be removed from this section.
</Callout>

`libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/formatters.ts`:

```ts copy
import type { Unit } from "@ledgerhq/types-cryptoassets";
import type { Account, Operation } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import { getAccountUnit } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/account/index";
import { formatCurrencyUnit } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/currencies/index";
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";

function formatAccountSpecifics(account: Account): string {
  const { myCoinResources } = account;
  if (!myCoinResources) {
    throw new Error("mycoin account expected");
  }

  const unit = getAccountUnit(account);
  const formatConfig = {
    disableRounding: true,
    alwaysShowSign: false,
    showCode: true,
  };

  let str = " ";

  str +=
    formatCurrencyUnit(unit, account.spendableBalance, formatConfig) +
    " spendable. ";

  if (myCoinResources.additionalBalance.gt(0)) {
    str +=
      formatCurrencyUnit(
        unit,
        myCoinResources.additionalBalance,
        formatConfig
      ) + " additional. ";
  }

  if (myCoinResources.nonce) {
    str += "\nonce : " + myCoinResources.nonce;
  }

  return str;
}

function formatOperationSpecifics(op: Operation, unit: ?Unit): string {
  const { additionalField } = op.extra;

  let str = " ";

  const formatConfig = {
    disableRounding: true,
    alwaysShowSign: false,
    showCode: true,
  };

  str +=
    additionalField && !additionalField.isNaN()
      ? `\n    additionalField: ${
          unit
            ? formatCurrencyUnit(unit, additionalField, formatConfig)
            : additionalField
        }`
      : "";

  return str;
}

export function fromOperationExtraRaw(extra: ?Object) {
  if (extra && extra.additionalField) {
    extra = {
      ...extra,
      additionalField: BigNumber(extra.additionalField),
    };
  }
  return extra;
}

export function toOperationExtraRaw(extra: ?Object) {
  if (extra && extra.additionalField) {
    extra = {
      ...extra,
      additionalField: extra.additionalField.toString(),
    };
  }
  return extra;
}

export default {
  formatAccountSpecifics,
  formatOperationSpecifics,
  fromOperationExtraRaw,
  toOperationExtraRaw,
};
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  <code>formatOperationSpecifics()</code> and <code>formatAccountSpecifics()</code> are used in the <Glossary word="CLI"></Glossary> to display account-specific fields and extras of the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> history, useful for debugging.
</Callout>

The same idea applies also to the `Transaction` type which needs to be serialized and formatted for CLI:

<Callout>
  This part may not be required if you don't need transactions for light sync.
</Callout>

`libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/transaction.ts`:

```ts copy
import type { Account } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import { getAccountUnit } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/account/index";
import { formatCurrencyUnit } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/currencies";
import {
  fromTransactionCommonRaw,
  toTransactionCommonRaw,
} from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/transaction/common";
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import type { <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary>, TransactionRaw } from "./types";

export const formatTransaction = (
  { mode, amount, recipient, useAllAmount }: <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary>,
  account: Account
): string =>
  `
${mode.toUpperCase()} ${
    useAllAmount
      ? "MAX"
      : amount.isZero()
      ? ""
      : " " +
        formatCurrencyUnit(getAccountUnit(account), amount, {
          showCode: true,
          disableRounding: true,
        })
  }${recipient ? `\nTO ${recipient}` : ""}`;

export const fromTransactionRaw = (tr: TransactionRaw): <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary> => {
  const common = fromTransactionCommonRaw(tr);
  return {
    ...common,
    family: tr.family,
    mode: tr.mode,
    fees: tr.fees ? BigNumber(tr.fees) : null,
  };
};

export const toTransactionRaw = (t: Transaction): TransactionRaw => {
  const common = toTransactionCommonRaw(t);
  return {
    ...common,
    family: t.family,
    mode: t.mode,
    fees: t.fees?.toString() || null,
  };
};

export default { formatTransaction, fromTransactionRaw, toTransactionRaw };
```

## Wrap your Node or Explorer

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In the code samples below, all references to operations are not needed at light sync step. They are currently necessary but will soon be removed from this section.
</Callout>

Before this part, you will need a node/explorer to get the state of an account on the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>, such as balances, <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary> (if your <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> uses something similar), and any data relevant to show or fetch in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

For the example, we will assume that <i>MyCoin</i> provides a <Glossary word="SDK"></Glossary> that is able to do both getting the state and the account history.

The best way to implement your <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> in Live Common is to create a dedicated `api` subfolder, that exports all functions that require calls to 3rd-party and map their responses to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> types.

```plaintext
./libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src
└── network
  ├── index.ts
  ├── <Glossary word="sdk"></Glossary>.ts
  └── types.ts
```

<Callout>
  Try to separate as much as possible your different network calls (if you use multiple providers) and use typings to ensure you map correctly <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> responses to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> types.
</Callout>

You will likely need to export thoses functions, but implemention is up-to-developer:

`libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/network/index.ts`:

```ts copy
export {
  getAccount,
  getOperations,
  getPreloadedData, // adjust with needs of preloaded data
  getFees,
  submit,
  disconnect, // if using persisting connection
} from "./sdk";
```

Basically, in the next sections, `getAccount` will be called to create an `Account` with balances and any additional resources, and `getOperations` will be called to fill the `operations[]` of this account, with the whole history of operations that can be requested incrementally. Then `getFees` before sending a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> to let the user know of the network cost (estimated or effective), and `submit` to broadcast its <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> after signing.

See [Polkadot Coin Integration's api](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/coin-modules/coin-polkadot/src/network) for good inspiration.

### API Example

Here is an example of a <i>MyCoin</i> <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> implementation using a fictive <Glossary word="SDK"></Glossary> that uses something like WebSocket to fetch data.

<Callout>
  We don't recommend using WebSocket as it could have drawbacks and is more difficult to scale up and put behind a reverse proxy. If possible, use HTTPS requests as much as possible.
</Callout>

```ts copy 
import MyCoinApi from "my-coin-sdk";
import type { MyCoinTransaction } from "my-coin-sdk";
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";

import { getEnv } from "@ledgerhq/live-env";
import { encodeOperationId } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/operation";

type AsyncApiFunction = (api: typeof MyCoinApi) => Promise<any>;

const MYCOIN_API_ENDPOINT = () => getEnv("MYCOIN_API_ENDPOINT");

let <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> = null;

/**

 */
async function withApi(execute: AsyncApiFunction): Promise<any> {
  // If client is instanciated already, ensure it is connected & ready
  if (api) {
    try {
      await <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.isReady;
    } catch (err) {
      <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> = null;
    }
  }

  if (!api) {
    <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> = new MyCoinApi(MYCOIN_API_ENDPOINT);
    <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.connect();
    <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.onClose(() => {
      <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> = null;
    });
    await <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.isReady;

};

/**

 */
export const getAccount = async (addr: string) =>
  withApi(async (api) => {
    const [balance, <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary>, blockHeight] = await Promise.all([
      <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.getBalance(addr),
      <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.getTransactionCount(addr),

export const getOperations = async (
  accountId: string,
  addr: string,
  startAt: number
): Promise<Operation[]> =>
  withApi(async (api) => {
    const rawTransactions = await <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.getHistory(addr, startAt);

    return rawTransactions.map((transaction) =>
      transactionToOperation(accountId, addr, transaction)
    );
  });
```

If you need to disconnect from your <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> after using it, update `src/network/index.ts` to add your <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> disconnect in the `disconnectAll` function, it will avoid tests and <Glossary word="CLI"></Glossary> to hang.

## Account Bridge

AccountBridge offers a generic abstraction to synchronize accounts and perform transactions.

It is designed for the end user frontend interface and is agnostic of the way it runs, has multiple implementations and does not know how the data is even stored: in fact **it's just a set of stateless functions**.

![account bridge flow](/blockchain/account-bridge-flow.png)

### Receive

The `receive` method allows to derivatives address of an account with a Ledger device but also display it on the device if verify is passed in.
As you may see in `coin-mycoin/src/bridge/index.ts`, CoinFramework provides a helper to implement it easily with `makeAccountBridgeReceive()`, and there are very few reasons to implement your own.

### Synchronization

We usually group the `scanAccounts` and `sync` into the same file `src/bridge/synchronisation.ts` as they both use similar logic as a `getAccountShape` function passed to helpers.

`libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/synchronisation.ts`:

```ts copy
import type { Account } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import { encodeAccountId } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/account/index";
import { makeSync, makeScanAccounts, mergeOps, type GetAccountShape } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/bridge/jsHelpers";

import { getAccount, getOperations } from "../network";

const getAccountShape: GetAccountShape = async (info) => {
  const { id, address, initialAccount } = info;
  const oldOperations = initialAccount?.operations || [];

  // Needed for incremental synchronisation
  const startAt = oldOperations.length
    ? (oldOperations[0].blockHeight || 0) + 1
    : 0;

  const accountId = encodeAccountId({
    type: "js",
    version: "2",
    currencyId: currency.id,
    xpubOrAddress: address,
    derivationMode,
  });

  // get the current account balance state depending your <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> implementation
  const { blockHeight, balance, additionalBalance, <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary> } = await getAccount(
    address
  );

  // Merge new operations with the previously synced ones
  const newOperations = await getOperations(id, address, startAt);
  const operations = mergeOps(oldOperations, newOperations);

  const shape = {
    id,
    balance,
    spendableBalance: balance,
    operationsCount: operations.length,
    blockHeight,
    myCoinResources: {
      <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary>,
      additionalBalance,
    },
  };

  return { ...shape, operations };
};

const postSync = (initial: Account, parent: Account) => parent;

export const scanAccounts = makeScanAccounts({ getAccountShape });
export const sync = makeSync({ getAccountShape, postSync });

```

The `scanAccounts` function performs the derivation of addresses for a given `currency` and `deviceId`, and returns an Observable that will notify every `Account` that it discovered.

With the `makeScanAccounts` helper, you only have to pass a `getAccountShape` function to execute the generic scan that <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> use with the correct derivation modes for <i>MyCoin</i>, and it will determine when to stop (generally as soon as an empty account was found).

The `sync` function performs one "Account synchronisation" which consists of refreshing all fields of a (previously created) Account from your <Glossary word="api"></Glossary>.

It is executed every 2 minutes if everything works as expected, but if it fails, a retry strategy will be executed with an increasing delay (to avoid burdening a failing API).

Under the hood of the `makeSync` helper, the returned value is an Observable of an updater function (Account=>Account), which is a pattern having some advantages:

- it avoids race conditions
- the updater is called in a reducer, and allows to produce an immutable state by applying the update to the latest account instance (with reconciliation on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> Desktop)
- it's an observable, so we can interrupt it when/if multiple updates occurs

In some cases, you might need to do a `postSync` patch to add some update logic after sync (<i>before the reconciliation that occurs on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> Desktop</i>). If this `postSync` function is complex, you should split this function in a `libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/postSyncPatch.js` file.

## Currency Bridge

### Scanning accounts

The `scanAccounts` function can be easily done directly in the `buildCurrencyBridge` function, by using `makeScanAccounts` helper.

This `makeScanAccounts` helper will automatically execute the default address derivation logic, but for some reason if you need to have a completely new way to scan account, you could then implement your own strategy.

## Icon --> TO MOVE TO DESKTOP/MOBILE

Icons are usually maintained by Ledger's design team, so you must first check that <i>MyCoin</i> icon is not already added in ledger-live-common, in [src/data/icons/svg](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/tree/master/src/data/icons/svg). It contains cleaned-up versions of Cryptocurrency Icons from [cryptoicons.co](http://cryptoicons.co/), organized by ticker.

If you need to add your own, they must respect those requirements:

- Clean SVG with **only** `<path>` elements representing the crypto
- Size and viewport must be `24x24`
- Icon should be `18x18` and centered / padded
- Flat-styled, and must respect crypto color scheme (filled)
- No background or decorative shape added
- No `<g>` or `transform`, `style` attributes...

Name should be the coin's <Glossary word="ticker"></Glossary> (e.g. `MYC.svg`) and must not conflict with an existing coin or token.

When building ledger-live-common, a [script](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/scripts/buildReactIcons.js) automatically converts them to React and React Native components.


## Starting with a mock

A mock will help you test different UI flows on Desktop and Mobile.
It's connected to any indexer / explorer and gives you a rough idea on how it will look like when connected to the UI.

For example you can use it by doing `MOCK=1 pnpm dev:lld` on `ledger-live-desktop`

```ts copy
import { BigNumber } from "bignumber.js";
import {
  NotEnoughBalance,
  RecipientRequired,
  InvalidAddress,
  FeeTooHigh,
} from "@ledgerhq/errors";
import type { <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary> } from "../types";
import type { AccountBridge, CurrencyBridge } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import {
  scanAccounts,
  signOperation,
  broadcast,
  sync,
  isInvalidRecipient,
} from "../../../bridge/mockHelpers";
import { getMainAccount } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/account/index";
import { makeAccountBridgeReceive } from "../../../bridge/mockHelpers";

const receive = makeAccountBridgeReceive();

const createTransaction = (): <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary> => ({
  family: "mycoin",
  mode: "send",
  amount: BigNumber(0),
  recipient: "",
  useAllAmount: false,
  fees: null,
});

const updateTransaction = (t, patch) => ({ ...t, ...patch });

const prepareTransaction = async (a, t) => t;

const estimateMaxSpendable = ({ account, parentAccount, <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> }) => {
  const mainAccount = getMainAccount(account, parentAccount);
  const estimatedFees = transaction?.fees || BigNumber(5000);
  return Promise.resolve(
    BigNumber.max(0, mainAccount.balance.minus(estimatedFees))
  );
};

const getTransactionStatus = (account, t) => {
  const errors = {};
  const warnings = {};
  const useAllAmount = !!t.useAllAmount;

  const estimatedFees = BigNumber(5000);

  const totalSpent = useAllAmount
    ? account.balance
    : BigNumber(t.amount).plus(estimatedFees);

  const amount = useAllAmount
    ? account.balance.minus(estimatedFees)
    : BigNumber(t.amount);

  if (amount.gt(0) && estimatedFees.times(10).gt(amount)) {
    warnings.amount = new FeeTooHigh();
  }

  if (totalSpent.gt(account.balance)) {
    errors.amount = new NotEnoughBalance();
  }

  if (!t.recipient) {
    errors.recipient = new RecipientRequired();
  } else if (isInvalidRecipient(t.recipient)) {
    errors.recipient = new InvalidAddress();
  }

  return Promise.resolve({
    errors,
    warnings,
    estimatedFees,
    amount,
    totalSpent,
  });
};

const accountBridge: AccountBridge<Transaction> = {
  estimateMaxSpendable,
  createTransaction,
  updateTransaction,
  getTransactionStatus,
  prepareTransaction,
  sync,
  receive,
  signOperation,
  broadcast,
};

const currencyBridge: CurrencyBridge = {
  scanAccounts,
  preload: async () => {},
  hydrate: () => {},
};

export default { currencyBridge, accountBridge };
```

## Split your code

You can now start to implement the JS bridge for <i>MyCoin</i>. It may need some changes back and forth between the types, your <Glossary word="api"></Glossary> wrapper, and the different files.

The skeleton of `libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/bridge/index.ts` should look something like this:

```ts copy
import getAddressWrapper from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/bridge/getAddressWrapper";
import {
  defaultUpdateTransaction,
  makeAccountBridgeReceive,
  makeScanAccounts,
} from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/bridge/jsHelpers";
import { CoinConfig } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/config";
import { SignerContext } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/signer";
import type { AccountBridge, CurrencyBridge } from "@ledgerhq/types-live";
import myCoinConfig, { type MyCoinConfig } from "../config";
import signerGetAddress from "../signer";
import { MyCoinAccount, MyCoinSigner, TransactionStatus, type <Glossary word="Transaction"></Glossary> } from "../types";
import { broadcast } from "./broadcast";
import { createTransaction } from "./createTransaction";
import { estimateMaxSpendable } from "./estimateMaxSpendable";
import { getTransactionStatus } from "./getTransactionStatus";
import { getPreloadStrategy, hydrate, preload } from "./preload";
import { prepareTransaction } from "./prepareTransaction";
import {
  assignFromAccountRaw,
  assignToAccountRaw,
  fromOperationExtraRaw,
  toOperationExtraRaw,
} from "./serialization";
import { buildSignOperation } from "./signOperation";
import { getAccountShape, sync } from "./synchronization";

function buildCurrencyBridge(signerContext: SignerContext<MyCoinSigner>): CurrencyBridge {
  const getAddress = signerGetAddress(signerContext);

  const scanAccounts = makeScanAccounts({
    getAccountShape,
    getAddressFn: getAddressWrapper(getAddress),
  });

  return {
    getPreloadStrategy,
    preload,
    hydrate,
    scanAccounts,
  };
}

function buildAccountBridge(
  signerContext: SignerContext<MyCoinSigner>,
): AccountBridge<Transaction, MyCoinAccount, TransactionStatus> {
  const getAddress = signerGetAddress(signerContext);

  const receive = makeAccountBridgeReceive(getAddressWrapper(getAddress));
  const signOperation = buildSignOperation(signerContext);

  return {
    estimateMaxSpendable,
    createTransaction,
    updateTransaction: defaultUpdateTransaction,
    getTransactionStatus,
    prepareTransaction,
    sync,
    receive,
    signOperation,
    broadcast,
    assignFromAccountRaw,
    assignToAccountRaw,
    fromOperationExtraRaw,
    toOperationExtraRaw,
  };
}

export function createBridges(
  signerContext: SignerContext<MyCoinSigner>,
  coinConfig: CoinConfig<MyCoinConfig>,
) {
  myCoinConfig.setCoinConfig(coinConfig);

  return {
    currencyBridge: buildCurrencyBridge(signerContext),
    accountBridge: buildAccountBridge(signerContext),
  };
}
```

<Callout>
  For better readability and maintainability, split your code into multiple files.

## Cache and performance (optional)

It is important to keep in mind that all currencies work independently and that Live Common provides a common framework to synchronize accounts with a polling strategy, and that network connectivity is not always stable and optimal.

Hence, the more cryptocurrencies <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> is using, the more requests and calculations are executed, which can take time.

To avoid making the same requests several times, we recommend using a local cache in your implementation (e.g. fees estimations, some currency data to preload, etc) in a `libs/coin-modules/coin-mycoin/src/network/cache.ts` file.

We have a [`makeLRUCache`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/coin-framework/src/cache.ts) function for creating Least-Recently-Used caches anywhere if needed.

See for example the [Polkadot's cache usage](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/coin-modules/coin-polkadot/src/network/index.ts).

## React Hooks

<Callout>
  CoinModules don't rely on any UI framework. They are UI-agnostic. Therefore, if you need to add React Hooks (or any UI specific behaviour), please add them in `libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/myCoin` directory.
</Callout>

If you are adding specific features to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> (like staking), you may need to access data through React hooks, that could provide common logic reusable for React components.

You are then free to add them in a `libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/mycoin/react.ts` file.

See examples like sorting and filtering validators, subscribing to preloaded data observable, or waiting for a transaction to be reflected in account, in the [Polkadot React hooks](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/polkadot/react.ts).
