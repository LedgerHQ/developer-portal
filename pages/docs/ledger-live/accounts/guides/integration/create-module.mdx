# 3 - Create Coin Module

## Organization

All CoinModules are located in [libs/coin-modules](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/coin-modules).

A CoinModule has the following directories/modules:
- `api` (optional): interface for exposing the CoinModule to a backend service (cf. (TODO))
- `bridge`: implementation of Bridges interface (cf. [Bridge](light-sync))
- `logic`: contains all core logic of the blockchain. The code here is agnostic of all external interface (i.e. Bridge or Api) and relies only on external libs and `network` directory
- `network`: communication logic with explorer/index/node (cf. [How to wrap you api](light-sync#wrap-your-api))
- `signer`: defines the interface definition to the Embedded App and the logic to retrieve [derive address](address-derivation)

## Some architectural decision
For consistency among all the CoinModule, please consider the following principles:
- Always use an `index.ts` file in each directory. The goal is to "control" what is exposed from the module and allow to be used from outside.
- The `index.ts` in the root of the CoinModule should only expose:
    - Bridge interface
    - Bridge type
    - bot test
    - ...
- Inside CoinModule, the dependency between module is only one direction (avoid cyclic dependency or mutual ones). Example: From the `logic` module, it is forbidden to use some functions declared in `bridge`.

## ...

The following steps (3-A to 3-D), your work will have some impact on the [Ledger Live repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledger-live-common).

Therefore, make sure [you have setup your environment](../../getting-started#setup) to work with `ledger-live`.
