# Ledger Live common bugs

## Dependency missing when installing the application

### How does it manifest? 

```bash copy
 ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_MISSING_DEPENDENCY  Broken lockfile: no entry for 'some_package' in pnpm-lock.yaml
```

### Quick fix

Run `pnpm clean` and then `pnpm install` at the root folder of the application.

### Explanation

This bug may appear if you have an older version of the Ledger Live application, and when you sync with the latest version, some dependencies are missing, or there are conflicts between them.

## Javascript Heap Out Of Memory

### How does it manifest? 

```bash copy
FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

### Quick fix

Run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8016` and then `pnpm install` again.

### Explanation

This generally occurs on larger projects where the default amount of memory allocated by Node (1.5 GB) is insufficient to complete the command successfully.



## ‘node:path’ dependency missing

### How does it manifest? 

```bash copy
Error: Cannot find module 'node: path'
```

### Quick fix

Run `nvm use 16` and then build Ledger Live again.

### Explanation

This is related to the node version. The `node:path` dependency is available from Node version 16 or above.
