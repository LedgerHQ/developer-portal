# Adding your blockchain to Ledger Live

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Process

Assuming you are on course for a Participant <Glossary word="Integration"></Glossary>, here is how we suggest working together.


### Phase 1 - You introduce your project

To start, please fill up the [**Ledger Live Integration application form**](https://ledger.typeform.com/LiveIntegration).

In this questionnaire, you will answer a set of questions that will help our team get a better understanding of the following aspects of your project:
- <Glossary word="Technical specificities"></Glossary> of your <Glossary word="Blockchain"></Glossary> and its ecosystem
- Connectivity to Third Party Services
- Scope of the desired integration

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    <ul>
        <li>- The <Glossary word="validation"></Glossary> of the scope AND of the technical feasibility of the <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> are required before starting the development phase.</li>
        <li>- Do not start the development phase before getting an official GO from the Ledger team.</li>
        <li>- We will not provide any <Glossary word="technical support"></Glossary> and/or code review to teams who did not get vetted by Ledger team upfront</li>
    </ul>
</Callout>


<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    <ul>
        <li>- Please be mindful when filling in this questionnaire, any unanswered or unclear question will delay the <Glossary word="review process"></Glossary>.</li>
        <li>- Ledger keeps the right to refuse and/or cancel any Participant <Glossary word="Integration"></Glossary> at any time without further notice or explanation.</li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

### Phase 2 - Ledger reviews your project candidature


Upon reception of your project information, Ledger will start reviewing it. 
Please note that we do receive a lot of submissions and our bandwidth is limited so it can take some time before you hear back from us, but don’t worry we do review all the applications. 


### Phase 3 - We clarify together the scope and technical specificities of your project

Upon review of your project information, Ledger will share a Google sheet document with your team.
This document is a breakdown of all questions / answers you provided in the Application form.

Most of the time, Ledger will require further clarifications about the information provided.
Ledger will use the “comment” feature of Google sheet to interact with your team.

Phase 4 ends when all items of the shared Gsheet are in status “validated”

### Phase 4 - Ledger gives you a final answer

Now that our team at Ledger have a full understanding of the <Glossary word="technical specificities"></Glossary> of your <Glossary word="Blockchain"></Glossary> and of the scope of the desired <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary>. There will be 3 options: 

**Option 1**: Ledger gives you an official GO and you can start working on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> on the full desired scope.

**Option 2**: Ledger gives you an official GO and you can start working on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> BUT on a reduced scope. 
For example, we could reduce the scope to send & receive only if we identify technical blockers that could put the <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> process at risk. 

**Option 3**: Ledger considers that for technical or business reasons your <Glossary word="Blockchain"></Glossary> can’t be integrated within <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>. 
This decision can be taken at Ledger sole discretion.


### Phase 5 - Integration kickoff

The Ledger team will plan a kickoff meeting in order to discuss the following:

- Scope and <Glossary word="Blockchain"></Glossary> specificities
- <Glossary word="Integration"></Glossary> steps and milestones
- How to get support from the Ledger team
- When to submit a PR
- Code review
- Maintenance

Our team will also be able to answer all the questions you might have. 

After this meeting, you are finally ready to start!
