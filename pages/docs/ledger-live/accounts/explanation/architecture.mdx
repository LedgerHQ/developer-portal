# General architecture

![App architecture](/blockchain/general-architecture-live.png)

- The Ledger device acts as a signing box and it defers most of the technical complexity to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> (Ledger's official **wallet application**). <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> contains the business logic and is (typically) a GUI, running on a computer or a phone connected to the device.
- The Ledger embedded application acts as a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> signer key in a deterministic way. Having an embedded application publicly listed in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> is a mandatory requirement before getting your <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> supported on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.
- In the case of <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, and for performance reason, a third layer is handling the indexing of <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> for a given <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>.

All the JavaScript code related to the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> applications is in the `ledger-live` monorepository. 

This library is built upon a pretty standard ES6 + Typescript stack and relies on a bunch of [ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs) packages, [RxJS 6.x](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/tree/6.x), [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) + [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) for some front-end utilities and hooks.

#### Coin Framework

The [Coin Framework](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/coin-framework) library is dedicated to coin integration. It provides utilities to help create Coin Modules with generic functions and a common interface signature.

#### Coin Modules

All integrated coins are implemented in their own coin module in the `libs` directory, following the naming convention. To be fully integrated, a `libs/ledger-live-common/src/families` dedicated folder needs to contain a few "glue" files - that can be shared by multiple crypto-assets that use the same implementation (i.e. Bitcoin-like coins share the same `bitcoin` family).

#### Live Common

The Common library of Ledger Live is called [Ledger-live-common](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledger-live-common). It provides a single library compatible with both desktop and mobile version of Ledger Live.

It includes a <Glossary word="CLI"></Glossary> for testing purpose or for using <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> features directly from a terminal (in a limited way).

It is designed to have very generic models and mechanics (for currencies, accounts, storage, synchronisation, events...) that also facilitates new <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> integrations through flexibility.


#### Communication with the Device

[ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs) is a set of packages. It allows a JavaScript
application to use the <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> of an <Glossary word="embedded app"></Glossary>. Ledger embedded apps are using APDU to
transfer data and commands to and from the external world. `ledgerjs` only
allows to use commands developed on the <Glossary word="embedded app"></Glossary>.


#### Communication with the different blockchains

The <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> application will retrieve <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> history and broadcast new transactions using different explorers.

As part of a <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary>, you should provide an indexer allowing a <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> user to synchronize his account in a timely manner. It can be an <Glossary word="open source"></Glossary> project or your own explorer.

The <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> application uses our own explorers for Bitcoin and <Glossary word="Ethereum"></Glossary> forks.
