## Open source, but not Open bar

The <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> code is <Glossary word="Open source"></Glossary> under MIT license. As such, you are free to copy/fork and modify it at will.

In some rare cases, you may want to go it alone, and do your own Solo <Glossary word="Integration"></Glossary>, where there is virtually no interaction with Ledger, nor code review, nor supported communication by Ledger to your <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> community. You are free to use this documentation in that way.

In most cases however, you will want to have your <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary> officially supported in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> for your community, with an updated release of <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> Desktop and Mobile. In this case it is a Participant <Glossary word="Integration"></Glossary>, because this involves various Ledger teams: Security, Product, Engineering and QA, we will have discussions with you to enter into an <Glossary word="Agreement Framework"></Glossary> in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities between us.
