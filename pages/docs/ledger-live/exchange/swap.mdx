  Note that if you are a non-KYC exchange and don't specifically wish to keep an UI of your own, we can use a pure API integration and you can skip section 1 & 3.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your API and endpoints to interact with our Backend.
- Generate a structured Payload and a signature with a specific format.
- Send your public key to Ledger and secure your private key.

### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Ledger Exchange Services Kit in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
- Provide a set of query parameters to access your LiveApp directly with the quote entered by the user in Ledger Live. 
- Write/Modify the Manifest file. 
- Follow our flow/UX requirements.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration by manually loading your LiveApp through Developer Mode (see [Ledger Services Kit doc](https://wallet.api.live.ledger.com/docs/discover/dapp-browser/manifest#load-your-live-app-locally-on-desktop)) and submit:
  - your API, 
  - your LiveApp Manifest,
  - your Public key.
