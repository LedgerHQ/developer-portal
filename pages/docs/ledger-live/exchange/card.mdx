# What do we need

In order to become a native Card provider in the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> endpoint to interact with our <Glossary word="Backend"></Glossary>.
- Generate a structured payload and a signature with a specific format.
- Send your public key to Ledger and secure your private key.

### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Ledger Exchange Services Kit in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
- Write/Modify the <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary> file. 
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration by manually loading your LiveApp through Developer Mode (see [Ledger Services Kit doc](https://wallet.api.live.ledger.com/docs/discover/dapp-browser/manifest#load-your-live-app-locally-on-desktop)) and submit:
  - Your <Glossary word="API"></Glossary>, 
  - Your LiveApp <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary>,
  - Your public key.

</Steps>
