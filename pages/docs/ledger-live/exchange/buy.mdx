# What do we need

In order to become a native Buy provider in the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Adapt to our Backend

- Adapt your <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> and endpoints to interact with our <Glossary word="Backend"></Glossary>.

### Develop/Modify your LiveApp

- Provide a set of query parameters to access your LiveApp directly with the quote entered by the user in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.
- Write/Modify the <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary> file.
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration by manually loading your LiveApp through Developer Mode (see [Ledger Services Kit doc](../../../../docs/discover/dapp-browser/manifest#load-your-live-app-locally-on-desktop)) and submit:

- your <Glossary word="API"></Glossary>,
- your LiveApp <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary>,

</Steps>

In the following pages, you will find:

- [Backend](buy/providers-backend): details on the main endpoints needed for the chosen operation.
- [LiveApp](buy/providers-liveapp): details on your LiveApp specifities, such as the LiveApp URL or the Manifest.
- [Test & Submit](buy/providers-test-and-submit): details on how to use the Ledger Live Developer Mode and other tools (coming soon) to test your integration end-to-end, as well as how to submit it.
