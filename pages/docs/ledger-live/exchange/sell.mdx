# What do we need

In order to become a native Sell provider in the Ledger Live ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your API and endpoints to interact with our Backend.
- Generate a structured payload and a signature with a specific format.
- Send your public key to Ledger and secure your private key.

### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Leger Exchange Services Kit in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
- Provide a set of query parameters to access your LiveApp directly with the quote entered by the user in Ledger Live. 
- Write/Modify the Manifest file. 
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration by manually loading your LiveApp through Developer Mode (see [Ledger Services Kit doc](../discover/dapp-browser/manifest#load-your-live-app-locally-on-desktop)) and submit:
  - Your API, 
  - Your LiveApp Manifest,
  - Your public key.

</Steps>
