# Backend

<BackendIntro />

## Endpoints needed for Card

In order to communicate with Ledgerâ€™s <Glossary word="backend"></Glossary>, you must provide standardised APIs for Ledger's CARD aggregator services to call.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”—">
You will find all the information regarding the CARD endpoints here: https://exchange-integration-fund.redoc.ly/, as well as additional details on some endpoints below.
</Callout>

You need to implement following endpoint for the card:
    - To create a signed fund binary payload: [/sell](https://exchange-integration-fund.redoc.ly/#operation/postSell).

<details>
  <summary>Additional Details: POST /sell</summary>

  Example request payload:
``` json copy
  {
  "quoteId": "string",
  "amount": "string",
  "refundAddress": "string",
  "fromCryptoCurrency": "string",
  "toFiatCurrency": "string",
  "payloadCryptoCurrency": "string",
  "nonce": "number",
  }
```

An example response from the your <Glossary word="backend"></Glossary> to the Ledger backend

  ``` json copy
{
  "sellId": "SELL-ID-165940",
  "payinAddress": "0xa0b86991c627e936c1d19d4a2e90a2ce3606eb48",
  "createdAt": "2030-05-26T14:13:39",
  "providerFees": "0.0001",
  "referralFees": "0.0001",
  "payoutNetworkFees": "0.0002",
  "providerSig": {
    "payload": "CgUweGZmZhoFMHhmZmYqBTB4ZmZmOgNCVENCA0JBVEoIMTIwMDAwMDBSCDExNTAwMDAwWhF2ZXJ5IGxvbmd1ZSBub25jZQ==",
    "signature": "MEUCIBRm4PrdgRw0aBwRepuOGGRmR/YPcCoyKNJ7UDjFO030AiEA/VT0anolum0a3X/9lGPeovZHqzeDG9brcUB4zhYmwbs="
  }
}
  ```

    Your Protobuf message should have the following structure:

    ```go copy
    syntax = "proto3";
    package ledger_sell;

    // (coefficient) * 10^(- exponent)
    message UDecimal {
        bytes  coefficient = 1;
        uint32 exponent = 2;
    }

    message NewSellResponse {
        string   trader_email = 1;           
        string   in_currency = 2;            
        bytes    in_amount = 3;              
        string   in_address = 4;             
        string   out_currency = 5;           
        UDecimal out_amount = 6;             
        bytes    device_transaction_id = 7;  
    }
    ```
</details>

## Real-time Status Updates:

To ensure effective communication with Ledger's backend, you are required to implement a webhook [/transaction/\{sellId\}/status](https://exchange-integration-fund.redoc.ly/#operation/statusUpdate) update mechanism. This should notify Ledger real-time whenever there is a change in the status of a transaction. Ledger will provide partners with the necessary webhook URL or address to which the status updates should be sent.

<details>
   <summary>Additional Details: POST /transaction/\{sellId\}/status</summary>
    Explanation of the different output `status`:
        - `FINISHED`: Trade has been completed successfully (user has received payout transaction).
        - `EXPIRED`: Payin <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> was not received in time, trade is cancelled. User will be refunded if payin <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> is received afterwards.
        - `ON_HOLD`: Trade has been put on hold (eg: for KYC reasons). User must contact support.
        - `PENDING`: Trade is in progress (provider is waiting to receive payin <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary>, or user is waiting to receive payout transaction)
        - `TRANSFER_IN_COMPLETED`: Transfer in completed and waiting for transfer out to be sent.
        - `REFUNDED`: Trade has been cancelled, refund <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> has been successfully received by user.
        - `UNKNOWN`: Trade is in unknown state. User must contact support.

</details>

Additionally, if your backend needs to know the transaction status from our system (e.g., whether the transaction was approved or rejected by the userâ€™s device), we provide an optional endpoint [/transaction/\{sellId\}/status](https://exchange-integration-fund.redoc.ly/#operation/getStatusUpdate)

[//]: # (Info needed to be exchange with the provider, but not out loud publicly)
[//]: # (**IP address checking** )
[//]: # (Additionally, we also need a way to know if a user will be able to perform a coin sell given his IP.)
[//]: # (Our back-end can adapt to how you decide to do this, but we recommend you use a dedicated endpoint. Our back-end will send the userâ€™s IP address to that endpoint, without logging it. In response, your endpoint should tell us if the trade is accepted or rejected.)



## Payload & Signature

Here is a little diagram to explain how the `payload` and the `signature` are generated:

<Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Payload and Payload Signature generation diagram"
      src="/exchange/payload-signature-generation-sell.png"
    />
</Zoom>

- `payload`: the trade parameters are assembled in a [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) message. Then using the protobuf tools we do a [binary encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) of the protobuf (Byte Array). Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `payload` field.
- `signature`: From the binary encoding of the previous [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (Byte Array), we sign it with [ES256](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ES256) and the provider's private key to get a Signature Byte Array. Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `signature` field ([more details](#jws-signature)).

### Signature usage

- Payload and Signature  
From the provider to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>. The payload is a protobuf message containing the trade data. It is generated by the provider and sent to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.
```go copy
type Payload struct {
  trader_email,
  in_currency,
  in_amount,
  in_address,
  out_currency,
  out_amount,
  device_transaction_id,
}
R, S := Sign(payload, privKey)
```

- Validate  
Exchange app checks and validates the payload (signature and content).
```go copy
// Compare <Glossary word="nonce"></Glossary> in payload
Verify((R, S), payload, pubKey)
```

- Display  
Exchange app requests approval to the user by displaying the operation summary on screen. 
```c copy
Validate?
Send currency_from amount_to_provider
Receive currency_to amount_to_wallet
```
