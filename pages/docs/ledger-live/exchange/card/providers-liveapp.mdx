# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Card Integration](../card) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some specific adjustments compared to the one found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Use the Ledger's [exchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
  - Have a modified, slightly more complex, Manifest file.
  - Follow specific flow/ux requirements.


## Ledger Exchange Services Kit

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the card, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../discover/getting-started).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the SDK with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

### CARD method

This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `quoteId`: The id coming from your system.
* `fromAccountId`: User's Ledger account id.
* `fromAmount`: Amount that will be sold.
* `toFiat`: Fiat currency that the user wants to be paid with using provider id.
* `rate`: The crypto/fiat rate.

```js copy
  exchangeSDK.sell({
  quoteId: "123abc",
  fromAccountId: "97f06be9-6fb2-5da3-be71-4e762ed6e115",// Ledger Live uuid4 account (can be a BTC account)
  fromAmount: new BigNumber(1),
  toFiat: "EUR", // provider fiat id
  rate: 66564, // crypto/fiat rate [BTC/EUR]
  type: "card"
  });
```

## Manifest Permission
Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:
```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
  "custom.exchange.start", 
  "custom.exchange.complete",
]
```

{/* <!-- ## Flow/UX requirements -->*/}

{/*Please refer to the [Flow Breakdown](../card/flow) section for more information. (should add the proper card flow later)*/}
