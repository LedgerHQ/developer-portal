# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Sell Integration](../sell) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Use the [Ledger Exchange Services Kit](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
  - Respond to specific LiveApp URL parameters in order to adapt to the flow inside <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.
  - Have a modified, slightly more complex, <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary> file.
  - Follow specific flow/ux requirements.


## Ledger Exchange Services Kit

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the sell, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../discover).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the <Glossary word="SDK"></Glossary> with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

### SELL method

This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `quoteId`: The id coming from your system and [forwarded to your LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter.
* `fromAccountId`: User's Ledger account id, [previously given to the LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter.
* `fromAmount`: Amount that will be sold.
* `toFiat`: Fiat currency that the user wants to be paid with using provider id.
* `rate`: The rate of the sell.

```js copy
  exchangeSDK.sell({
  quoteId: "123abc",
  fromAccountId: "97f06be9-6fb2-5da3-be71-4e762ed6e115",// <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> uuid4 account (can be a BTC account)
  fromAmount: new BigNumber(1),
  toFiat: "EUR", // provider fiat id
  rate: 90000, // crypto/fiat rate [BTC/EUR]
  });
```

## LiveApp URL

The LiveApp needs to respond to a URL with some parameters. LiveApp URLs are used to open your LiveApp with the quote values that the user already entered in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

The LiveApp URL format is already fixed and will depend on the information you provided inside your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) (ex: `ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername`).


  * `account-id`: Userâ€™s selected account id, where the crypto he wants to sell is stored.
  * `crypto-currency`: The crypto currency that the user wants to sell. It will contain the providerId value to identify the crypto.
  * `fiat-currency`: The fiat currency that the user wants to be paid with.
  * `crypto-amount`: The crypto amount that the user wants to sell.
  * `payment-method`: The preferred payment method for the user.
  * `mode`: `buy` or `sell`. In this case always sell. Required you share the same base widget url for both usages.
  * `bank-residency`: The bank residency of the user.
  * `ledger-transaction-id`: id used by ledger to track transactions and their completion statuses.

__Example__:
```
https://sell.provider.widget.com?[account-id]=ua11-â€¦&[crypto-currency]=BTC&[fiat-currency]=EUR&[crypto-amount]=0.04
```

  Ledger needs to know how to send referral information through the widget.

## Manifest Permission
Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:
```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
  "custom.exchange.start", 
  "custom.exchange.complete",
]
```

{/* <!-- ## Flow/UX requirements -->*/}

{/*Please refer to the [Flow Breakdown](../sell/flow) section for more information. (should add the proper sell flow later)*/}
