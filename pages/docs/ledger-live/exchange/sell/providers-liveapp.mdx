# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Sell Integration](../sell) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must:

- Use the [Ledger Exchange Services Kit](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
- Respond to specific LiveApp URL parameters in order to adapt to the flow inside Ledger Live.
- Have a modified, slightly more complex, Manifest file.
- Follow specific flow/ux requirements.

## Ledger Exchange Services Kit

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the sell, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../discover/getting-started).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the SDK with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

```js copy
const exchangeSDK = new ExchangeSDK("yourProviderId");
```

### SELL method

This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

- `quoteId`: The id coming from your system and [forwarded to your LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter.
- `fromAccountId`: User's Ledger account id, [previously given to the LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter.
- `fromAmount`: Amount that will be sold.
- `toFiat`: Fiat currency that the user wants to be paid with using provider id.
- `rate`: The crypto/fiat rate.

```js copy
exchangeSDK.sell({
  quoteId: "123abc",
  fromAccountId: "97f06be9-6fb2-5da3-be71-4e762ed6e115", // Ledger Live uuid4 account (can be a BTC account)
  fromAmount: new BigNumber(1),
  toFiat: "EUR", // provider fiat id
  rate: 66564, // crypto/fiat rate [BTC/EUR]
  type: "SELL",
});
```

## LiveApp URL

The LiveApp needs to respond to a URL with some parameters. LiveApp URLs are used to open your LiveApp with the quote values that the user already entered in Ledger Live.

The LiveApp URL format is already fixed and will depend on the information you provided inside your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) (ex: `ledgerlive://discover/sellprovidername`).

- `accountId`: Userâ€™s selected account id, where the crypto he wants to sell is stored.
- `cryptoCurrency`: The crypto currency that the user wants to sell. It will contain the [LedgerID](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/ledger-live/exchange/sell/providers-backend#ledger-ids-mapping) value to identify the crypto.
- `fiatCurrency`: The fiat currency that the user wants to be paid with.
- `cryptoAmount`: The crypto amount that the user wants to sell.
- `paymentMethod`: The preferred payment method for the user.
- `mode`: `buy` or `sell`. In this case always sell. Required you share the same base widget url for both usages.
- `bankResidency`: User's Country Code (ALPHA-2)
- `ledgerTransactionId`: ID used by Ledger to track transactions and their completion statuses.
- `customParameters`: Used to include additional URL-encoded key-value parameters in the widget URL.For example: `widgetid%3D247312%26ledgerlive%3Dtrue`.

**Example**:

```
https://sell.provider.widget.com?[accountId]=ua11-â€¦&[cryptoCurrency]=bitcoin&[fiatCurrency]=EUR&[cryptoAmount]=0.04
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
  Ledger needs to know how to send referral information through the widget.
</Callout>

## Manifest Permission

Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:

```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
  "custom.exchange.start",
  "custom.exchange.complete",
  "custom.exchange.error",
]
```

## Key Generation for Production and Test Environments

To ensure secure communication, you must generate two sets of keys: one for the production environment and one for the test environment. Follow the steps below to generate these keys:

# Testing with the Development Key

After submitting [your keys](/docs/ledger-live/exchange/sell/providers-backend#generate-privatepublic-key) to us and once the CAL team has successfully integrated them, you can proceed to test your integration in Ledger Live.

### Steps to Test in Ledger Live

1. Open the **Settings** menu in Ledger Live.
2. Navigate to the **Developer** tab.
3. Locate the setting labeled **Exchange in Test Partner Mode**.
4. Enable this setting to activate the test environment.

With this mode enabled, you can verify the functionality of your keys and ensure everything is working as expected in the test environment.
