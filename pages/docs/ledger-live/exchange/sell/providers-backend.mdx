# Backend

<BackendIntro />

## Endpoints needed for Sell

In order to communicate with Ledger’s backend, you must provide standardised APIs for Ledger's SELL aggregator services to call.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔗">
  You will find all the information regarding the SELL endpoints here:
  https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/, as well as additional details on
  some endpoints below.
</Callout>

There are 4 main endpoints needed for the sell: - To get the list of available fiat, country, payment, method and amount: [/capabilities](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getCapabilities). - To get the list of available crypto-currencies: [/crypto-currencies](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getCryptoCurrencies). - To get the fiat amount that the user should expect -after all fees are deducted - as a payment for the given crypto amount: [/quotes](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getQuote). - To create a signed sell binary payload: [/sell](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/postSell).

<details>
  <summary>Additional Details: POST /sell</summary>

Example request payload:

```json copy
{
  "quoteId": "string",
  "amount": "string",
  "refundAddress": "string",
  "fromCryptoCurrency": "string",
  "toFiatCurrency": "string",
  "payloadCryptoCurrency": "string",
  "nonce": "number"
}
```

An example response from the your backend to the Ledger backend

```json copy
{
  "sellId": "SELL-ID-165940",
  "payinAddress": "0xa0b86991c627e936c1d19d4a2e90a2ce3606eb48",
  "createdAt": "2030-05-26T14:13:39",
  "providerFees": "0.0001",
  "referralFees": "0.0001",
  "payoutNetworkFees": "0.0002",
  "providerSig": {
    "payload": "CgUweGZmZhoFMHhmZmYqBTB4ZmZmOgNCVENCA0JBVEoIMTIwMDAwMDBSCDExNTAwMDAwWhF2ZXJ5IGxvbmd1ZSBub25jZQ==",
    "signature": "MEUCIBRm4PrdgRw0aBwRepuOGGRmR/YPcCoyKNJ7UDjFO030AiEA/VT0anolum0a3X/9lGPeovZHqzeDG9brcUB4zhYmwbs="
  }
}
```

    Your Protobuf message should have the following structure:

    ```go copy
    syntax = "proto3";
    package ledger_sell;

    // (coefficient) * 10^(- exponent)
    message UDecimal {
        bytes  coefficient = 1;
        uint32 exponent = 2;
    }

    message NewSellResponse {
        string   trader_email = 1;
        string   in_currency = 2;
        bytes    in_amount = 3;
        string   in_address = 4;
        string   out_currency = 5;
        UDecimal out_amount = 6;
        bytes    device_transaction_id = 7;
    }
    ```
    `in_amount` amount must be in the lowest unit of the coin, encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian.

    - 1 **BTC** would be `0x5F5E100` (100000000 in hexadecimal). The smallest unit is a **satoshi** which is `10^-8` **BTC**.
    So multiply 1 **BTC** by `10^8` → `0x5F5E100`.
    And `0x5F5E100` encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian is `[0x00, ... 0x00, 0x05, 0xF5, 0xE1, 0x00]`.
    - 2 **ETH** would be `0x1BC16D674EC80000` (or 2000000000000000000). The smallest unit is a **wei** which is `10^-18` **ETH**.
    So multiply 2 **ETH** by `10^18` → `0x1BC16D674EC80000`.
    And `0x1BC16D674EC80000` encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian is `[0x00, ... 0x00, 0x1B, 0xC1, 0x6D, 0x67, 0x4E, 0xC8, 0x00, 0x00]`.

## Real-time Status Updates:

To ensure effective communication with Ledger's backend, you are required to implement a webhook [/transaction/\{sellId\}/status](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/statusUpdate) update mechanism. This should notify Ledger real-time whenever there is a change in the status of a transaction. Ledger will provide partners with the necessary webhook URL or address to which the status updates should be sent.

<details>
  <summary>Additional Details: POST /transaction/\{sellId\}/status</summary>
    Explanation of the different output `status`:
        - `FINISHED`: Trade has been completed successfully (user has received payout transaction).
        - `EXPIRED`: Payin transaction was not received in time, trade is cancelled. User will be refunded if payin transaction is received afterwards.
        - `ON_HOLD`: Trade has been put on hold (eg: for KYC reasons). User must contact support.
        - `PENDING`: Trade is in progress (provider is waiting to receive payin transaction, or user is waiting to receive payout transaction)
        - `TRANSFER_IN_COMPLETED`: Transfer in completed and waiting for transfer out to be sent.
        - `REFUNDED`: Trade has been cancelled, refund transaction has been successfully received by user.
        - `UNKNOWN`: Trade is in unknown state. User must contact support.

</details>

Additionally, if your backend needs to know the transaction status from our system (e.g., whether the transaction was approved or rejected by the user’s device), we provide an optional endpoint [/transaction/\{sellId\}/status](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getStatusUpdate)

[//]: # "Info needed to be exchange with the provider, but not out loud publicly"
[//]: # "**IP address checking** "
[//]: # "Additionally, we also need a way to know if a user will be able to perform a coin sell given his IP."
[//]: # "Our back-end can adapt to how you decide to do this, but we recommend you use a dedicated endpoint. Our back-end will send the user’s IP address to that endpoint, without logging it. In response, your endpoint should tell us if the trade is accepted or rejected."

## Payload & Signature

Here is a little diagram to explain how the `payload` and the `signature` are generated:

<Zoom>
  <img
    alt="Payload and Payload Signature generation diagram"
    src="/exchange/payload-signature-generation-sell.png"
  />
</Zoom>

- `payload`: the trade parameters are assembled in a [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) message. Then using the protobuf tools we do a [binary encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) of the protobuf (Byte Array). Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `payload` field.
- `signature`: From the [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded payload of the previous [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (Byte Array), we sign it with [ES256](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ES256) and the provider's private key to get a Signature Byte Array. Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `signature` field ([more details](#jws-signature)).

If you need help with the signing process, please refer to our code [examples](code-examples.mdx).

### Generate Private/Public Key

1. **Private Key**:
   Use the following command to generate the private key:

   ```bash
   openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout -out sample-priv-key-secp256k1.pem
   ```

2. **Public Key**:
   Derive the public key from the private key using the command:
   ```bash
   openssl ec -in sample-priv-key-secp256k1.pem -pubout > sample-pub-key-secp256k1.pem
   ```

### Verify Key Information

To inspect the contents of the private key file:

```bash
openssl ec -text -in sample-priv-key-secp256k1.pem
```

Repeat this process for both the **production** and **test** environments to generate two distinct key pairs.

### Signature usage

- Payload and Signature  
  From the provider to Ledger Live. The payload is a protobuf message containing the trade data. It is generated by the provider and sent to Ledger Live.

```go copy
type Payload struct {
  trader_email,
  in_currency,
  in_amount,
  in_address,
  out_currency,
  out_amount,
  device_transaction_id,
}
R, S := Sign(payload, privKey)
```

- Validate  
  Exchange app checks and validates the payload (signature and content).

```go copy
// Compare nonce in payload
Verify((R, S), payload, pubKey)
```

- Display  
  Exchange app requests approval to the user by displaying the operation summary on screen.

```c copy
Validate?
Send currency_from amount_to_provider
Receive currency_to amount_to_wallet
```
