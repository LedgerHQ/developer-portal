## Endpoints needed for Buy

In order to communicate with Ledger’s backend, you must provide standardised APIs for Ledger's BUY aggregator services to call.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔗">
You will find all the information regarding the BUY endpoints here: https://exchange-integration-buy.redoc.ly/.
</Callout>


There are 3 main endpoints needed for the buy:
    - To get the list of available fiat, country, payment, method and amount: [/capabilities](https://exchange-integration-buy.redoc.ly/#operation/getCapabilities).
    - To get the list of available crypto-currencies: [/crypto-currencies](https://exchange-integration-buy.redoc.ly/#operation/getCrypto-currencies).
    - To get the crypto amount that the user should expect -after all fees are deducted - as a payment for the given fiat amount: [/quotes](https://exchange-integration-buy.redoc.ly/#operation/getQuote).  




[//]: # (Info needed to be exchange with the provider, but not out loud publicly)
[//]: # (**IP address checking** )
[//]: # (Additionally, we also need a way to know if a user will be able to perform a coin swap given his IP.)
[//]: # (Our back-end can adapt to how you decide to do this, but we recommend you use a dedicated endpoint. Our back-end will send the user’s IP address to that endpoint, without logging it. In response, your endpoint should tell us if the trade is accepted or rejected.)
