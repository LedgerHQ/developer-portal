# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Swap Integration](../swap) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Use the [Ledger Exchange Services Kit](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Ledger Services Kit.
  - Respond to specific LiveApp URLs in order to adapt to the flow inside <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.
  - Have a modified, slightly more complex, <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary> file.
  - Follow specifics flow/ux requirements.


## Ledger Exchange Services Kit

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the swap, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../discover).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the <Glossary word="SDK"></Glossary> with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

### SWAP Method  

This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `quoteId`: the id coming from your system and [forwarded to your LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `fromAccountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `toAccountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `fromAmount`: amount that will be sent from `fromAddressId` to `payinAddress`
* `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.
* `rate`: rate differences in the pair, [previously given to the LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter

```js copy
  exchangeSDK.swap({
    quoteId: "1234",
    fromAccountId: "07AB5930-C73A-433F-A2FA-920640AF3A02",
    toAccountId: "76A239EB-1C2A-4237-B942-CA87472106EB",
    fromAmount: "12.3",
    feeStrategy: "SLOW",
    rate: 0.7555,    
  });
```

## LiveApp URL

The LiveApp needs to respond to an URL with some parameters. LiveApp URLs are used to open your LiveApp with the quote values that the user already entered in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

The LiveApp URL format is already fixed and will depend on the information you provided inside your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) (ex: `ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername`).


  * `quoteId`: The id retrieved by Ledger's <Glossary word="backend"></Glossary> during a quote request.
  * `fromAmount`: The amount of currency.
  * `fromAccountId`: The user's account id in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> repository.
  * `toAccountId`: The user's account id in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> repository.
  * `rate`: the rate differences in the pair.
  * `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.
  * `initFeeTotalValue`: initial <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> total fee.
  * `customFeeConfig`(optional, required for `CUSTOM` feeStrategy): Custom fee configuration in case the strategy is of type `CUSTOM`. The key-value object is encoded in URI parameter.
  * `ledger-transaction-id`: id used by ledger to track transactions and their completion statuses.
  * `fiatCurrencyId`: The fiat currency id used as reference for the quote.
  * `theme`: The theme used in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.
  * `displayLanguage`: The language used in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

__Example__:
```
ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername?quoteId=1234&fromAmount=0.09&fromAccountId=82f48c06-6170-536e-a21b-56b30b02b58d&toAccountId=c0c4493e-fc4b-50b6-b1a0-566f1a751521&rate=79.09405555555555555556&feeStrategy=CUSTOM&initFeeTotalValue=878198522989412&customFeeConfig=%7B%22maxFeePerGas%22%3A%2212000000000%22%2C%22maxPriorityFeePerGas%22%3A%221000000000%22%2C%22userGasLimit%22%3Anull%2C%22gasLimit%22%3A%2221000%22%7D
```

## Manifest Permission
Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:
```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
  "custom.exchange.start",
  "custom.exchange.complete",
]
```
