# Swap : CEX integrated as a LiveApp 

Our goal is to offer the best swap experience for our users in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, by providing competitive quotes and security.

To offer our centralize exchange partners the best time-to-market and and our users the best swap experience, we have built an hybrid solution:
- Native swap marketplace: An aggregator on <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> listing our partners depending on the region, token coverage and prices.
- Partner Web app: A LiveApp experience (embedded web app) where users interact with the partner web app in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, once they want to finalize the swap. The <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> is performed with ExchangeSDK.

This section of the documentation explains how the swap feature is displayed to the user in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> and how your web app is integrated into this hybrid solution.
