# Quote display and user preferences

## Input

To chose a swap service, the user selects:

1. A source cryptocurrency and a source [account](../glossary)
2. An amount from the source account to swap
3. The destination <Glossary word="cryptocurrency"></Glossary> and the destination account

## Output

According to the input amount, the partner's <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> is called to get a quote and check several conditions:
- Region  (AVAILABLE / NOT AVAILABLE) 
- Token (AVAILABLE / NOT AVAILABLE) 
- Amount (TOO LOW / TOO HIGH)

If all of the above conditions are validated, the partners are displayed in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> with the following information. Between several CEX offers, `amountFrom` and network fee being the same, quotes are sorted by `amount to`, the first "best value" quote being the one offering the greatest `Receiving amount`: 
1. Network fees to send crypto to partners  - payinNetworkFees
2. Partner quote
	- **a.** Partner image
	- **b.** Partner name
	- **c.** Registration policy of the partner : Needed / Not needed
	- **d.** Exchange rate of the current swap, after all fees are applied: ex : 1 ETH = 0.0549919 BTC
	- **e.** Fixed or Floating: When it is fixed, the quote is guaranteed. The user must accept the quote within a certain amount of time (the quote must be guaranteed for at least 60 seconds). When it is floating, the quote is not guaranteed. The user can receive less than the quote according to the market fluctuation but should be protected against a maximum slippage defined by the partner
	- **f.** Receiving amount: ex = want to Swap 0.04301 ETH, receiving 0.0023652 BTC
