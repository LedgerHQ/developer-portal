2. The user is asked then to open the app exchange on their Ledger device
3. The user is redirected to the Confirmation drawer with information sent from the partner payload
4. The user checks if the information displayed on the Ledger device is the same as in the drawer
5. The user approves the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> on his Ledger device. Transactions are broadcasted on the  <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>. 
6. The partner receives the amount and performs the swap
