# Edge cases

- **Refund** - A crypto amount is sent to the partner but the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> can’t be done. The funds are sent back to the user minus payin network fees. We recommend the Partner to check that the amount to swap is more than twice above payoutnetwork fees to always send a positive balance to the users.
- **Extra information needed from user** - <Glossary word="Ledger live"></Glossary> indicates to the user the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> is “on hold” and that the user needs to contact the partner’s user support.
- **Login for partners both available on swap and buy** - we expect login to work for  both apps, meaning that when a user logged on buy, they do not have to log again on swap, during a time frame set by the partner.
