# Detailed Technical Flows

## Overview diagram

This is a [C4 diagram](https://c4model.com/) that describes an overview of the exchange during the swap process.

  Although the provider's LiveApp is embedded inside <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, we describe it
  as running in a separate environment because it is sandboxed.

## Detailed transaction flow

Explanations about each step below the diagram.

1. Ledger Live opens the provider's LiveApp through a [deeplink](./providers-liveapp#deeplink). Example:

```
ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername?quoteId=CC14E626-CF1B-4EDA-AF5E-766FFD5A3457&
fromAddress=bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq&
toAddress=0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268&
fromAddressId=AF1A7BD4-6A9A-4491-A540-98B1C7AD2407&
toAddressId=6EA9F270-91C5-4832-9A44-2713F9A6F6F0
```

    The `quoteId` sent is the one coming from a previous request to the `/quote` endpoint of the Provider's <Glossary word="backend"></Glossary>. This id is linked to the `fromCurrency` and `toCurrency` wanted by the user.

2. The provider's LiveApp starts Ledger's swap process through a call to ExchangeSDK method call: `swap`.

3. After asking the user to start the process, Ledger's Swap Service will call the Provider's backend to generate and sign the `payload`. The backend will also returns a `swapId`, for [status tracking purpose](#check-swap-status-flow).

4. The Provider's <Glossary word="backend"></Glossary> will generate the payload with Ledger's currency id. This part is important as Ledger's device only knows Ledger's referential currency.

5. The Provider's <Glossary word="backend"></Glossary> will sign the payload with its private key. The public part must be previously sent to Ledger and must use secp256k1 curve.

6. As soon as the user signs the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> within his Ledger's device, <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> will broadcast the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary>.

7. The `transactionId` is returned in the response of the `swap` method, called by the LiveApp.

8. The LiveApp should call back <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> with a deeplink. Example: `ledgerlive://swap?status=COMPLETED&swapId=123`
