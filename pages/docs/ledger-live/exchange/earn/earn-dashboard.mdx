# Earn dashboard integration

The Earn section in Ledger Live allows users to track their staking positions. Users staking assets through Ledger Live must be able to view their positions for each account used for staking:

To display such information, Ledger Live's backend needs to communicate with your service through standardised APIs.

## Endpoints needed

For each account used for staking, the Earn section in Ledger Live provides users with the following information:
- **The staked amount**: total staked assets in the account.
- **The rewards %**: Should always return NET APY (Annual Percentage Yield).
- **Rewards earned**: total reward earned to date. Includes any rewards that were claimed.

These information must be accessible through your API.
Moreover, depending on the staking protocols, this data should be exposed by your API for each validator address and/or pool ID, along with a detailed breakdown of rewards for specified periods (e.g., 24 hours, last 7 days, etc.).

In addition, Ledger also needs to know:

- The base url of the API,
- Any backend authentication information needed to use the api (token in headerâ€¦),
- Refresh rate. Positions and rewards should be reflected as soon as they are available on chain
- Rate limit. Specify the rate limit of your API. Desired rate limit: unlimited.
- Provide error codes for what qualifies as up (e.g 200, 404, etc) and down (e.g 500 or timeout).
