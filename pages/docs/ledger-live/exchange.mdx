<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  There are two types of integration:
  - Autonomous first step integration: your LiveApp is accessible through the “Discover” section. For this integration, you can skip the API integration and refer to the [Discover](/docs/discover) section instead.  
  - Main flow: your LiveApp can be integrated natively to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>. Better exposition but with additional <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary>. More details in this section.
