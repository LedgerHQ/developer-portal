# Getting Started with the Ledger Services Kit

Welcome to the getting started guide for the Ledger Services Kit. We are excited to have you onboard and look forward to
seeing what you'll create.

The Ledger Services Kit can be integrated with both client and server-side applications, offering you flexibility and
enabling diverse use-cases.

## Installation

Let's begin by installing the base package.

You can use your favorite package manager, npm, yarn or pnpm, to install the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client
```

### Using the Ledger Services Kit with React

We offer a specific package to facilitate easy <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> of the Ledger Services Kit:
`@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react`.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-client-react
```

This package provides handy React hooks to interact with the Ledger Services Kit.

### Testing with Simulator

To test the Ledger Services Kit without connecting to the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> App directly, you can use the
`@ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator
```

Remember, this package currently only functions with server-side applications due to a dependency requiring the usage
of `process`.

Now that you've successfully installed the necessary packages, you're ready to start crafting with Ledger's Wallet
API. In the next page, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and configuring the Ledger Services Kit in your
application.
