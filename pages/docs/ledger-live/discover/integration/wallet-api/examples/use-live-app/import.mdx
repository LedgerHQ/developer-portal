# Import your manifest in Ledger Live

If not done already, you must have Ledger Live Desktop installed on your computer. Head over to the [download page](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download) to get started.

You also need your Ledger Device (Nano S or X) in order to access <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

In order to add a local <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> and run a not yet available <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary>, you must enable the <Glossary word="Developer mode"></Glossary>.

To activate the <Glossary word="Developer mode"></Glossary> in <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, go to :

1. **Settings** -> **About**
2. Click ten times on the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> version.

You will then see a new **Developer** section in the settings menu.

Once done, make sure to turn on **Enable platform dev tools** as it will allow you to open a browser-like developer tools window to inspect your app.

Then click on **Browse** next to **Add a local app** and select the manifest you created in the [previous section](./manifest.mdx).

![browse](./assets/3-3-browse.png)

You will then see a new row in the menu with the name of your <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary>.

Now that you have added your <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary> in your local <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> application, it’s time to open it and test it.

We’ll see this in the next section.
