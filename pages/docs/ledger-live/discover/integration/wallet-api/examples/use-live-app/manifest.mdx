# Create a manifest

In order to test your <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary> inside <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, you will first need to create a <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary>.

A <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> is a `.json` file providing information about your <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary>.

Create a `manifest.json` file at the root of your project and use the following content as a starter:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://live-app-catalog.ledger.com/schema.json",
  "id": "replace-app-name",
  "name": "ReplaceAppName",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "homepageUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",
  "platform": ["ios", "android", "desktop"],
  "apiVersion": "^2.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "2",
  "branch": "stable",
  "categories": ["ReplaceCatagories"],
  "currencies": "*",
  "content": {
    "shortDescription": {
      "en": "Desc"
    },
    "description": {
      "en": "Desc"
    }
  },
  "permissions": [
    "account.list",
    "account.receive",
    "account.request",
    "currency.list",
    "message.sign",
    "transaction.sign",
    "transaction.signAndBroadcast",
    "wallet.capabilities",
    "wallet.info",
    "wallet.userId"
  ],
  "domains": ["http://", "https://"],
  "visibility": "complete"
}
```

We won't go too much into the details of each field in this tutorial (check out the manifest file reference [here](../../appendix/manifest/) for explanation of each field).

The main thing you have to care about for now is the `url` field, it must match the url of your <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary>. Here it is set at `http://localhost:3000` because we are currently running our app in local for development and test purposes.

Now that we have our <Glossary word="Live App"></Glossary> <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary>, we need to add it into <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>, this is what we will see in the next section.
