## Currency Module Overview

Access the Currency module via `walletApiClient.currency`.

### Methods:

#### 1. List Cryptocurrencies

List the cryptocurrencies supported by the connected wallet. You can optionally provide filters by currency IDs.

```javascript
walletApiClient.currency.list(params?: { currencyIds?: string[] }): Promise<Currency[]>
```

**Parameters**:
- `params` (optional): An object which may contain:
- `currencyIds` (optional): An array of strings specifying the currency IDs to filter the cryptocurrencies.

**Returns**: A promise that resolves with an array of Currency objects.

[**Required permission**:](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/ledger-live/discover/guides/wallet-api/appendix/manifest#permissions)
 `currency.list`

##### Example:

```javascript
async function listCurrencies(walletApiClient, currencyIds) {
  try {
    // List all supported cryptocurrencies
    const currencies = await walletApiClient.currency.list();
    console.log('Supported cryptocurrencies:', currencies);

    // Optionally, filter by currency IDs
    const filteredCurrencies = await walletApiClient.currency.list({ currencyIds: currencyIds });
    console.log('Filtered cryptocurrencies:', filteredCurrencies);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error listing cryptocurrencies:', error);
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Filtering by currency IDs is marked as beta and may not be fully implemented yet.

## Handling Errors

Make sure to handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to the user. Additionally, always remember to disconnect the `WindowMessageTransport` when you're done interacting with the Ledger Services Kit to free up resources.
