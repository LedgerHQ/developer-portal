# Configuring the Ledger Services Kit Core Client

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and initialize the Ledger Services Kit Core client to interact with the Ledger Services Kit. This client allows you to communicate with Ledger devices, retrieve account information, and perform transactions.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client` packages is installed in your project.

## Initializing the Ledger Services Kit Client

To initialize the Ledger Services Kit client, you need to set up a transport layer. The `WindowMessageTransport` class is provided by the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-core` package and reexposed by `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client` and is responsible for communication between your application and Ledger devices.

Here's a step-by-step example to initialize the Ledger Services Kit client:

```javascript
import { WalletAPIClient, WindowMessageTransport } from "@ledgerhq/wallet-api-client";

async function initializeWalletApiClient() {
  // Step 1: Initialize and connect the Window Message Transport
  const windowMessageTransport = new WindowMessageTransport();
  windowMessageTransport.connect();

  // Step 2: Initialize Services Kit Client with the Window Message Transport
  const walletApiClient = new WalletAPIClient(windowMessageTransport);

  // the Ledger Services Kit client is now initialized, and you can use it to interact with Services Kit.
  // For example, accessing accounts:
  // const accounts = await walletApiClient.account.getAccounts();

  // Your application logic here...

  // Step 3: Disconnect when done to ensure the communication is properly closed
  windowMessageTransport.disconnect();
}

// Execute the function
initializeWalletApiClient().catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

Once the Ledger Services Kit client is initialized, you can use its methods to interact with Ledger devices.
Make sure to check the <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> documentation for a comprehensive list of available methods.

## Disconnecting

When you're done with your operations, it's important to disconnect the `WindowMessageTransport` to close the communication channel properly. You can do this by calling the `disconnect` method on the `WindowMessageTransport` instance as shown in the example above.
