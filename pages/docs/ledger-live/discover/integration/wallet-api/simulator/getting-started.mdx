# Getting Started

In this guide, we will walk through how to set up the Ledger Services Kit simulator to connect the client to a mock environment, instead of the real <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> environment.

This is especially helpful during development and testing phases, where you might not want to perform actions on the real <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

## Installation

Let's begin by installing the base package.

You can use your favorite package manager, npm, yarn or pnpm, to install the `@ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @ledgerhq/wallet-api-simulator
```

---

Now that you've successfully installed the necessary packages, you're ready to start crafting with Ledger's Wallet
API. In the next page, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and configuring the Ledger Services Kit in your
application.
