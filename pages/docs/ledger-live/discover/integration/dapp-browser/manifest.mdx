# Write and load the manifest

If you have followed instructions on the previous page, you should now be ready to interact with the dApp directly from <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> interface to make sure all the basic features work as expected.

Your dApp will be ran inside the <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary> webview with an injected provider.

To test and integrate your application, you first need to write your application <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary> file.
This file must contain some mandatory information, such as the app package names, the components, the permissions needed, the hardware and software features, etc.

Check and if necessary edit your manifest file as described [below](#example-of-manifest-json-format-for-the-lido-application).

### Load your Live App locally on desktop

To load your Live App locally, [unlock the Developer mode](../../references/developer-mode/) in Ledger Live and [add a local app](../../references/developer-mode#add-a-local-app).

### Load your Live App locally on mobile (Android only)

Go to the **Settings** -> **Developer** section, and click on **Load Platform Manifest** you can copy your <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> here and load it.
