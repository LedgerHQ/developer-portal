# Load a dApp in Ledger Live Discover

## Write and load the manifest

To test and integrate the application, you first need to write your application <Glossary word="Manifest"></Glossary> file.
This file must contain some mandatory information, such as the app package names, the components, the permissions needed, the hardware and software features, etc.

## Load your Live App locally on desktop

To load your Live App locally, [unlock the Developer mode](../references/developer-mode) in Ledger Live and [add a local app](../references/developer-mode#add-a-local-app).


This option will allow you to browse for local files and add a <Glossary word="local app"></Glossary> using a local <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary>.
With it you can be autonomous in testing your application.
Youâ€™ll have to load your own <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> to make your application appear in the Discover section.


## Load your Live App locally on mobile (Android only)

Go to the **Settings** -> **Developer** section, and click on **Load Platform Manifest** you can copy your <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> here and load it.
