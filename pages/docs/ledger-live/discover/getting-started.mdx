# Adding a Live App to the Discover section

## Integration process

The integration of an app in the Discover section of Ledger is done on an invitation only basis.

If you are not already in contact with one of our teams and want to introduce your project, fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2e4BAfuZJOUYKhqcxMvMGNY12ShZ-UG5Lu0Se8AIVdlu2lA/viewform) and contact us at discover@ledger.fr.

## Development steps

### 1. Prerequisites

Before integrating your dApp in the Discover section, you have to make sure the interactions with Ledger devices is possible. To do so use the Device Management Kit, as explained [in this section](../../device-interaction/getting-started).

### 2. dAppBrowser and Ledger Services kit / Manifest

There are two options when it comes to integrating into Ledger Live and the are detailed in this section.

#### **The dAppBrowser (EVM Only)**

Using the dAppBrowser consists of:
	- [updating your dApp](./integration/dapp-browser/dapp-customisation)
	- [creating and loading a manifest](./integration/dapp-browser/manifest), directing it to the dAppBrowser

#### **the Ledger Services Kit (for other protocols)**

The Ledger Services Kit pathway is more code-intensive, requiring a deeper engagement from developers. However, it grants a more granular control over the core wallet features within Ledger Live. A thorough understanding of the Ledger Services Kit can be gleaned from the official documentation.  

### 3. Clear signing (EVM only)

The next step is to ensure your dApps users will be able to clear sign their transaction. For more information about clear signing read [this setion](../../clear-signing/understanding/what-is-it).
