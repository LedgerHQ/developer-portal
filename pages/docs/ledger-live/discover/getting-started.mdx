# Adding a Live App to the Discover section

## Integration process

The <Glossary word="integration"></Glossary> of an app in the Discover section of Ledger is done on an invitation only basis.

## Pathways to integration: dAppBrowser vs. Ledger Services Kit

There are two options when it comes to integrating into Ledger Live

- **The dAppBrowser (EVM Only for now)**

This one is only available to EVM based dApps for now. By crafting a <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary>, directing it to the dAppBrowser, and incorporating the <Glossary word="Iframe Provider"></Glossary> in their app, developers can quickly add their application to <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>.

- **the Ledger Services Kit**

The Ledger Services Kit pathway is more code-intensive, requiring a deeper engagement from developers. However, it grants a more granular control over the core wallet features within <Glossary word="Ledger Live"></Glossary>. A thorough understanding of the Ledger Services Kit can be gleaned from the official documentation.
