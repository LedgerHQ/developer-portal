## Accounts or Blockchain integration

If you already have a [Ledger device application](../device-app/getting-started) and are looking for a way to get your blockchain supported on Ledger Live (available in the "Accounts" section of Ledger Live), follow the [Accounts documentation](./accounts/getting-started).

To confirm if your embedded application is already supported, please check if your currency is visible on [this page](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/).

## Discover

If you have to use the dApp Browser or the Ledger Services Kit to integrate your app as a Live App in the Discover section, follow the [Discover documentation](./discover/getting-started).

## Exchange provider

If you are an exchange provider and want to integrate swap/sell/buy service or the card service, follow the [Exchange provider documentation](./exchange).
