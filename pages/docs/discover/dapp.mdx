- **Agreement** between you and Ledger regarding the [Terms & Conditions](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live-integration-terms-and-conditions), and validation of the integration by Ledger. The Agreement can be finalised during the development phase, as there may already be a common understanding.
