# Get your Live App in Discover

## What are Live Apps and Discover?

A Live App is a web application that incorporates the Wallet API, providing convenience and security for Ledger Live users when interacting with web3 projects.

The Discover section is a dedicated area within Ledger Live that includes a Live App browser, enabling users to access any Live Apps via its search bar and also showcasing a carefully selected list of apps on the main UI.

The guiding principle behind the Apps available through Discover, or Live Apps, is to provide a secure and enjoyable experience for users to access web3 apps and offer developers an opportunity to succeed. We achieve this by providing a carefully selected collection of web3 apps, each of which undergoes a thorough review by our team, ensuring that users can discover new apps every day with peace of mind. For everything else, users can always turn to the open Internet. If the Live App model and guidelines do not fit your app or business idea, don't worry. We also support Wallet Connect through Ledger Live, providing a great web experience.

## Integration structure for DApps and other Web3 apps

- **DApps** are applications based on EVM. 
- **Non-DApps** are applications based on other protocols.

In either cases, a Live App is a web version of your application, which is then integrated into an iframe within Ledger Live. This means that you will be hosting the app, not Ledger.

Depending on whether you have a **DApp** or a **non-DApp** to integrate in to the Discover section of Ledger Live, this diagram summarizes what you need to do.
