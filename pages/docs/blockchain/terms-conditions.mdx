To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, in no event will Ledger be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, data, business or goodwill or business interruption. 

As part of the onboarding process, Ledger may conduct a technical review of your Blockchain Service to identify bugs or other faults. This technical review shall not constitute a vetting or endorsement of the Blockchain Service by Ledger, nor does it create any kind of partnership between you and Ledger or limit your responsibility for your Blockchain Service. Ledger shall not be responsible or liable for any damages caused to any third parties by your Blockchain Service.

Ledger services, software, firmware and hardware are subject to change without notice, which may require that you perform an update on your Blockchain Service at your own cost to ensure ongoing compatibility with Ledger services, software, firmware and hardware products. Please keep yourself informed of such changes by following  the relevant developer channel on Discord or any communication channel initially set up with Ledger.

As a Blockchain Service developer, you assume total responsibility and risks for your Blockchain Service and any damage that your application may cause to third parties or to Ledger. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, all the necessary steps to maintain the continuity of the availability and the performance of the Blockchain Service you have developed and provided. You shall, at all times and at your own cost, test and update the Blockchain Service you have developed in order for your Blockchain Service to be fully functional with the latest Ledger updates and plugins and Blockchain protocol upgrades, as well as, mitigate all risks and incidents that may affect your Blockchain Service, or the use of your Blockchain Service by any third party.

You warrant that your Blockchain Service will not cause any obvious fault or malfunction in any software, firmware, hardware or network and information system, nor shall introduce any viruses or vulnerabilities into Ledger services, software, firmware or hardware. You warrant that the Blockchain Service will operate in accordance with Ledger and user expectations and that the maintenance of your Blockchain Service will be of satisfactory quality and conform to the requirements to function with Ledger services, software, firmware and hardware.

The Blockchain Service you submit must be distributed under an open source license. You warrant that your submission of a Blockchain Service is not in breach of any third party‚Äôs intellectual property rights or other rights and you agree to indemnify and hold Ledger harmless in case of a claim brought by a third party against Ledger regarding the Blockchain Service you have provided. You warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all permissions, licenses and consents necessary to provide the Blockchain Service.

As part of the submission of your Blockchain Service to Ledger, you will be required to provide personal information such as your name, country of residence, etc. This information will be processed in accordance with Ledger‚Äôs privacy policy and may be communicated to users in Ledger Live, in particular where and when the disclosure of this information to the users is a legal requirement.
Ledger reserves the right to reject the integration, hosting or support of a Blockchain Service at its sole discretion and without providing any justification.

By providing a Blockchain Service, you are giving Ledger the right to communicate about the said Blockchain Service. Ledger will use its discretion as to whether or not to communicate on the new integration of a Blockchain Service and the way it communicates.
Nothing will impair Ledger‚Äôs right to develop, integrate, promote or distribute blockchains that perform the same or similar functions or achieve the same result as the Blockchain Service you have submitted for integration.
