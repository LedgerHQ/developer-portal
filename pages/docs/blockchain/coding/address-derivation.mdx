# 3 - Address derivation

From step 3 to step 6, you work will be implemented in the [Ledger Live repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledger-live-common).

### Derive Address from device

Before starting this step, make sure [you have setup your environment](../setup-build) to work with `ledger-live`.

First define the signer interface, which will reflect your [embedded app js binding](./js-bindings):

```ts copy
export type MyCoinAddress = {
  address: string,
  publicKey: string,
  returnCode: number,
};
export type MyCoinSignature = {
  signature: Buffer | null,
  returnCode: number
};
export interface MyCoinSigner {
  getAddress(path: string, display?: bool): Promise<MyCoinAddress>;
  sign(path: string, message: string): Promise<MyCoinSignature>;
}
```

Then get an address from the device for <i>MyCoin</i>, by creating the `hw-getAddress.ts` Resolver:

`libs/coin-mycoin/src/hw-getAddress.js`:

```ts copy
import type { GetAddressFn } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/bridge/getAddressWrapper";
import type { SignerContext } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/signer";
import type { GetAddressOptions } from "@ledgerhq/coin-framework/derivation";
import type { MyCoinAddress, MyCoinSignature, MyCoinSigner } from "./signer";

const resolver = (
  signerContext: SignerContext<MyCoinSigner, MyCoinAddress | MyCoinSignature>,
): GetAddressFn => {
  return async (deviceId: string, { path, verify }: GetAddressOptions) => {
    const address = (await signerContext(deviceId, signer =>
      signer.getAddress(path, verify),
    )) as PolkadotAddress;
    return {
      address: address.address,
      publicKey: address.pubKey,
      path,
    };
  };
};

export default resolver;
```

Test that you can derive an address:

```sh
ledger-live getAddress --currency mycoin --path "44'/8008'/0'/0/0" --derivationMode ""
```

### Derivation

Ledger Live uses the BIP44 derivation mode by default (as `derivationMode=""`), which is standard and most common way for HD wallet.
If <i>MyCoin</i> has a conventional derivation path (BIP44), Ledger Live should already be able to derive an address correctly.

**If you need to use another derivation mode:**

Make changes to [`libs/ledger-live-common/src/derivation.ts`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/coin-framework/src/derivation.ts):

1. Add a new derivation mode with `overridesDerivation`:
  ```ts copy
  // const modes = Object.freeze({
  // ...
    mycoinbip44h: { // Hardened BIP44 for MyCoin
      overridesDerivation: "44'/8008'/<account>'/0'/<address>'",
    },
  // });
  ```
2. Add the mode to family in `legacyDerivations`:
  ```ts copy
  // const legacyDerivations: $Shape<CryptoCurrencyConfig<DerivationMode[]>> = {
  // ...
    mycoin: ["mycoinbip44h"],
  // };
  ```
3. Disable the default use of BIP44 in `disableBIP44`:
  ```ts copy
  // const disableBIP44 = {
  // ...
    mycoin: true,
  // };
  ```
4. Add the coin to `seedIdentifierPath`:
  ```ts copy
  // const seedIdentifierPath = {
  // ...
    mycoin: `${purpose}'/${coinType}'/0'/0'/0'`,
  // };
  ```

See [Derivation documentation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/wiki/LLC:derivation) for further details.

You can check that the derivationMode is correct by executing:

```sh copy
pnpm build:cli
pnpm run:cli  getAddress --currency=mycoin --path="44'/8008'/0'/0/0" --derivationMode=""
```
