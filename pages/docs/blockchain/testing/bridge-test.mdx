# Live Common Bridge Test

This page describes how tests are implemented in order to test live-common bridge.

- Transaction status
- Account synchronisation

The approach is to test transactions and accounts synchronisation for the different currencies supported in Ledger Live. The transactions are not Broadcasted to the blockchain. We just verify that the bridge behave properly regarding to a tx inputs (recipient address, amount, fee…).

We record the synchronisation state to produce an expected output (Number of accounts, account balance, fresh address…).

For a specific currency, the seed used needs to be frozen, it’s mean that no new operation should be on the accounts used in the dataset as been recorded neither new accounts created.

By doing so we can ensure that the account synchronisation and the transaction status will always provide the same results.

## Currency / Account bridge

This section will explain how to generate and add test cases for Accounts and Currencies.

Dataset location: `ledger-live/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/{currency}`

### Sync accounts

Generate sync dataset (needs a Ledger device connected with the corresponding app opened).

```sh copy
pnpm run:cli generateTestScanAccounts -c <currency>    #Record the APDUs exchanged with the device
```

Then copy the result in:

`ledger-live/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/<currency>/datasets/<currency>.scanAccounts.1.ts`

### Send (get transaction status)

Only verify that transaction status is OK, sign and broadcast are out of the scope of those tests.

Test cases: [TestRail](https://ledger.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/overview/9)

Generate account data:

```sh copy
pnpm run:cli generateTestTransaction -c bitcoin -i 1 -s 'native_segwit' --recipient 13LcRWZyZnZu1xrABuAK9Ayftg4kfVs1AA --amount 0.002
```

Then copy the result in:

`ledger-live/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/<currency>/datasets/<currency>.ts` or `ledger-live/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/<currency>/bridge.integration.test.ts`

```js copy
const dataset: CurrenciesData<Transaction> = {
  scanAccounts: [scanAccounts1],
  accounts: [
    {
      transactions: [
        {
          name: "on native segwit recipient",

            amount: "997",
            feePerByte: "1",
            networkInfo

          expectedStatus: {

            estimatedFees: BigNumber("250"),
            totalSpent: BigNumber("1247"),
            errors: {},

            derivationPath: "44'/0'/0'/0/59"
          }
        ],

      }
    }
  ]
};
```

More specific tests can be written in `ledger-live/libs/ledger-live-common/src/families/<currency>/bridge.integration.test.ts`

After adding or modify a test you must run from the root of `ledger-live`:

```sh copy
pnpm common build
```

**Record new outputs**:

When running the integration tests, new snapshots will be generated that you can commit as expected results for the tests.

```sh copy
pnpm common ci-test-integration <family>
```
