# UI/UX Guidelines

## Introduction

These guidelines will help you to use existing UI/UX Flows for Ledger Live Desktop. In addition, it contains instructions to create new Flows, where existing ones are similar so that they can be used as a template. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact us on Discord.

  The mechanism described below is for Ledger Live Desktop. There is a similar mechanism in Ledger Live Mobile, but without the LLDCoinFamily type at the moment.

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Family            | A large piece of code that is common to several similar coins.               | EVM, Bitcoin, Cosmos |
| Flow              | A sequence of Screens for a particular transaction, from the pov of the User.| Send Flow            |
| Screen            | Part of a Flow.                                                              |                      |

| Standard Code     | UI/UX code that any Coin can use without additional coding. Here, ‚ÄúCode‚Äù can mean any part of the Flow. | EVM, Bitcoin, Cosmos |
| Pre-existing Code | All the UI/UX code that you can get inspiration from.                        |                      |
| MyCoin Code       | Only the UI/UX code of MyCoin  (I.e., your Coin).                            |                      |

## Preliminary warning

**Careful attention** is required to verify and ensure code (Components) really need to be created. 
Keep in mind, any unnecessary duplication of code, will entail a tech debt, which means your code will take longer to be integrated by the Ledger teams. 

Although the Ledger Live Desktop (LLD) and Ledger Live Mobile (LLM) code is similar, you cannot swap the code around. The code for LLD doesn‚Äôt work on LLM and vice versa. 

## A - Check if Ledger Live already has the Flow you need

If it does, there is nothing to do. You do not need to use those Components in your MyCoin code, the Ledger Live code will do what is necessary.

If it does not, follow step B.

## B - Customization

### 1. Check if Live already supports the customization you need.

The list of Components that can already be customized is in the `LLDCoinFamily` type [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/docs/blob/develop/apps/ledger-live-desktop/src/renderer/families/types.ts). You can consider **any** Component from **any** Family Member. **In the Existing code, identify the Component that are the closest to what you are going to develop.**

When they are customisable, you can create your own Component, with the same name. By using the correct name, the Component will be created in the right place and it will **override** the standard Component. (If you delete your Component, the Standard Component will taken as default)


<Callout type="info" emoji="üëâ">
  In each of the existing Family members, look in <b>index.ts</b> to see which Component (listed there) are different from the Standard Component. These Differences are listed in the <b>Import</b> header section
</Callout>

On running `pnpm i`, MyCoin will be added in `apps/ledger-live-desktop/src/renderer/families/generated.ts` if it doesn‚Äôt already exist (as an example, [see Algorand](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/docs/tree/develop/apps/ledger-live-desktop/src/renderer/families/algorand)). 

Therefore this list of Components is enriched over time with the different updates and changes of Ledger Live.

### 2. Create the folder structure in MyCoin

In `/apps/ledger-live-desktop/src/renderer/families/MyCoin/`

1. Create **Index**: follow the structure of other Index files you can find
2. Optionally create **Types**. If you have specific (Coin) type definitions put them here
In each folder (of each coin), you‚Äôll find code related to the UI of that coin only. For example, [in the Polkadot family](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/docs/tree/develop/apps/ledger-live-desktop/src/renderer/families/polkadot), there are many examples of UI custom Components:
  - token bond (BondFlowModal),
  - validator nomination (NominationFlowModal), 
These two Components are used in the Staking Flow of Polkadot
3. Follow with case 3a or 3b

### 3a - Ledger Live already supports the customization you need

You just need to write your custom Component. It must be in the set of Components listed in LLDCoinFamily. If it isn‚Äôt then goto Case 3b.

### 3b - Ledger Live does not support the customization you need

You also need to write your custom Component. But in this case, it is not in `LLDCoinFamily`.
You need to **declare** it there by adding the definition of the type of the Component you want to Customize.

Then you need to **integrate** the custom Component at the right place in Ledger Live code. Add a Link to the common code, in the corresponding section.
For example with `apps/ledger-live-desktop/src/renderer/screens/account/AccountStakeBanner.tsx`, find an appropriate place in renderer:

```ts copy
import { getLLDCoinFamily } from "~/renderer/families";
   const Comp = getLLDCoinFamily(account.currency.family)?.MyComponent;
   if (Comp) return <Comp account={account} />;
   return null;
```
