# Setup

This step is getting the plugin to compile. But first, we need to set up the working environment linked to the Ethereum app.

## Clone the Ethereum App

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum
cd app-ethereum
```

## Build the Ethereum App

You can easily build the Ethereum app by following these [instructions](../../embedded-app/build-load).

Once you've successfully compiled the Ethereum app you are ready to walk through the Boilerplate plugin example.
