# Query Contract ID

The Ethereum App asks for information to be displayed. For the moment, it just wants an overview of this method (in our case, a swap). Let's look at what needs to be done.

The Nanos devices screens have two lines. For example:
```
|  Ledger  |    <-- Upper line
|   Rocks   |    <-- Bottom line
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
    For Stax devices it's possible to display more than 2 lines. The Ethereum application takes care of filling an entire screen before moving to the next one. As for the plugin, the functionality is the same for both Stax and Nanos devices.
</Callout>

In this call, the upper line is `msg->name`. It is the Plugin name.
The bottom line is `msg->version` (legacy name, etc.). It is the action context, for example "Stake", "Vote", "Buy", etc. In our example, the user is swapping, so we use "Swap".

The boilerplate repository already contains code that copies `PLUGIN_NAME` to `msg->name`, so we only need to handle the `switch` case condition:
```c copy
switch (context->selectorIndex) {
    case SWAP_EXACTH_ETH_FOR_TOKENS:
        strlcpy(msg->version, "Swap", msg->versionLength);
        break;
}
```

This results in the following screen:
```
| Uniswap |
|    Swap    |
```

That's it! Now we can proceed to the last section.
