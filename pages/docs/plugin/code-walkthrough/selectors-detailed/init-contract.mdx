# Init Contract

The first case condition is `handle_init_contract`.  
In the corresponding `handle_init_contract.c`, `selectorIndex` is set as the first parameter to parse. Let's dive deeper into the parameters.

Methods in a smart contract have parameters (or arguments). For example, `swapExactEthforTokens` has this format:

```js copy
swapExactETHForTokens(uint256 amountOutMin,
                                                           address[] path,
                                                           address to,
                                                           uint256 deadline)
```

So, the parameters for this function are:
1. `uint256 amountOutMin`: is the minimum amount in tokens the user will get from their swap.
2. `address[] path`: is an array of paths. If we look at the contract source code on Etherscan, the only paths used are `path[0]` and `path[1]`, where `path[0]` is the OUTGOING token, and `path[1]` the INCOMING one.
3. `address to`: is the address to which the tokens are sent back.
4. `uint256 deadline`: is the swap deadline after which it will fail.

These parameters are passed to your plugin in the same format order of the function. Parameters always have 32 bytes. 

The goal of this plugin is to display on the Ledger screen: the amount of ETH from the wallet, the return currency and address to which the tokens are sent.

Hence, we need to parse `amountOutMin`, `path[1]`, and `to`. We don't care about `deadline` since we will not show this information. We also don't need to parse `path[0]` since we know we are sending `ETH`.

Parsing these fields is done in the next call, `handle_provide_parameter.c`. We need to set the first parameter to parse, `amountOutMin`.

```c
switch (context->selectorIndex) {
    case SWAP_EXACT_ETH_FOR_TOKENS:
        context->next_param = MIN_AMOUNT_RECEIVED;
        break;
    case BOILERPLATE_DUMMY_2:
        context->next_param = TOKEN_RECEIVED;
        break;
    // Keep this
    default:
        PRINTF("Missing selectorIndex: %d\n", context->selectorIndex);
        msg->result = ETH_PLUGIN_RESULT_ERROR;
        return;
}
```
<Callout>
  To trap errors in the plugin <code>msg->result</code> is set to <code>ETH_PLUGIN_RESULT_ERROR</code>
</Callout>

Now let's not forget to add this name to `parameter` in `boilerplate_plugin.h`.

```c copy
typedef enum {
    MIN_AMOUNT_RECEIVED = 0, // Min amount of tokens the user will get
    TOKEN_RECEIVED, // Address of the tokens the user is swapping to
    BENEFICIARY, // Address of the recipient of the tokens
    // ...
} parameter;
```

Next, let's jump into `handle_provide_parameter.c`.
