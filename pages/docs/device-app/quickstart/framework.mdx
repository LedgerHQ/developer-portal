# The Ledger Framework

## Your project port of entry: the App Boilerplate

An App Boilerplate to test our Framework and to kickstart your Device App project for Nano S Plus, Nano X and Ledger Stax. See how to build it and load it on a device [in this section](./build-load).

[Click here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate) to fork the repository and start your project.

## Ledger Visual Studio Code Extension

The Ledger Visual Studio Extension leverages our Docker image, the app dev tool, so that it is always up to date with the latest standards and dependences. It contains the toolchain and the complete test framework (Speculos + Ragger).

It includes the following actions:

- Build the Embedded App for all devices
- Load an App on your device
- Execute functional tests
- Test the App with Speculos
- Open a terminal in your docker container
- Clean build files
- Update container

See how to use them [in this section](./build-load).


## CI

In the App Boilerplate you will find [a list of workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/tree/master/.github/workflows) to set up an efficient CI pipeline for your project. 

Two of these workflows are a requirement to submit your embedded application:
- [Build_and_functional_tests](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml), which will build the app and run functional tests using the Ragger framework upon Speculos emulation
- [Guidelines_enforcer](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/guidelines_enforcer.yml), which calls a reusable workflow guidelines_enforcer developed by Ledger's internal developer team


## Ragger

A Python framework which aims at simplifying the test and overall automatic manipulation of applications running on Ledger devices. It is used by the App Boilerplate's CI. You can read the full Ragger documentation [here](https://ledgerhq.github.io/ragger/).

## Speculos

A Ledger device simulator. It is used by the App Boilerplate's CI. You can read the full Speculos documentation [here](https://speculos.ledger.com/).
