# Build & Load App

With the [Ledger Framework](./framework), you can build and load Embedded Apps on Linux, Mac and Windows, very easily, with the Visual Code Ledger extension.

## Prerequisites
 
- Docker
- An X11 server
- Visual Studio Code
- [The Ledger extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)


## How-to build and load

1. Have Docker running. Note: Not needed on Linux because this is already a background task.
2. Open the [Boilerplate App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate) or your own App in Visual Studio Code
3. Use Ledger extension's sidebar menu or open the tasks menu with `ctrl + shift + b` (`command + shift + b` on a Mac) to conveniently execute actions:
	- To pull and run the Docker image chose `Run dev-tools image`
	- To build your app chose `Build app`
	- To load it to a device, chose `Load app on device`


For more information, or if you want to manually Build and Load your app, read the [Boilerplate App documentation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate).

## Actions flow

The other actions are described in the [Boilerplate App repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate).

Here is the usual flow for using theses actions:
