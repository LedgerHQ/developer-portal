# Global architecture

Let’s see the typical end-to-end architecture of a BOLOS application, in the case of an app for a cryptocurrency:

Three pieces of software are required:
- A BOLOS application, written in C, running on a Ledger device
- The with business logic and typically a GUI, running on a computer or a phone connected to the Ledger device
- A transaction explorer that interfaces between the front-end and the cryptocurrency daemon, running either locally (in the case of a full node) or remotely (light wallet)

If you’re not developing an app adding support for a cryptocurrency, then you can ignore the 3rd piece. Depending on your use case, the wallet app might be a simple daemon or a command line tool, without a GUI.

The Ledger Manager is the service which centralizes the distribution of [BOLOS](../bolos) applications on Ledger devices. It is the place where both Ledger’s apps and third party apps are distributed to users.
