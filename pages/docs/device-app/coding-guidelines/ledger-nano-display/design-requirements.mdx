# Interface

Most of the time, Ledger embedded apps have few functionalities. However, despite this simplicity, it is still challenging to build a user-friendly interface, because of the few inputs (only 2 buttons) and the screen size (128\*32 pixels). The following guidelines will give a good basis to ensure user-friendliness.

## Guidelines

### Welcome screen

The Device icon must be displayed on the first welcome screen.

### Information display

1. It is a good practice to inform the user of what kind of information is currently displayed, by giving it a title. There should not be a colon after the title.
2. To avoid having to much text on the same screen, use successive screens that can be switched back and forth using the left and right button.
3. The send flow should be: Amount â†’ Destination â†’ Fees (if applicable) â†’ Memo (if applicable)


### Graphical pointers

The user can perform four principal actions by pressing 1 button or 2 buttons simultaneously:
-   Make a binary choice to answer a question asked by the device (1 button)
-   Browse through the entries of a menu (1 button)
-   Select a menu entry (2 buttons)
-   Proceed with a disclaimer (2 buttons)

The graphical pointers (glyphs) indicates which action can be performed on a screen.

**Binary choice**

To propose a binary choice to the user, 2 glyphs representing the 2 choices should be placed on each side of the screen:
- a cross symbol to cancel 
- a validation symbol to accept 
You can display a question and relevant information in between the glyphs, like in the upper example.

**Browse**

To browse through a menu, the same technique is applied with different glyphs. We recommend using horizontal menus only with left and right arrows for navigation.

It's preferable for a menu (Dashboard or Settings) to be a carrousel, so the user can go back easily at the beginning when they've reached the last item. This is **not applicable** to signing transactions, as the user should not be able to reach by mistake the validating screen without having checked the address entirely.


**Select and proceed**

Once positioned on the right menu entry, the user can select the entry by pressing both buttons. This action is not represented by glyphs. Same goes when going through a set of disclaimer screens: only text is displayed, and the user goes to the next part by pressing both buttons. 

This is a consistent behaviour across the device, so you can assume that users are used to it.

### "About" and "Settings" sections

The sections "About" and "Settings" must only be created if they contain more than one screen. If you have only one screen to display, include it in the Dashboard flow.

In the "Settings" section, follow this flow: Blind signing (if applicable) â†’ Debug data (if applicable) â†’ Nonce (if applicable) â†’ Back
