# Display Management Design

## Layouts

Layouts are nothing more than rules that specify the format / number of lines / fonts we are going to use on the screen. They are easy to remember once you understand that:

-   `b` stands for **bold**.
-   `n` stands for **normal**.
-   `p` stands for **picture**.
-   `paging` means that if the data doesn't fit on screen, user will be able to navigate through multiple screens to see the data (e.g a public key).
-   Finally, the number of letters used stands for the **number of lines**

Note that **not all combinations of letters are possible**. For example `paging` only exists with `bnnn`. `nnnn` only exists on Nano X, etc...

This table contains the **most commonly used layouts**:

| Denomination  | Comment                         | Usage                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `bn`          | Bold font for the first line, normal font for the second line. | `bn, {"BoldLine", "NormalLine"}`   |
| `pb`          | Picture for the first line, bold font for the second line.     | `pb, {&RefToPicture, "BoldLine"}`  |
| `pnn`         | Picture for the first line, normal font for the second line and third line. | `pnn, {&RefToPicture, "NormalLine1", "NormalLine2"}` |
| `bnnn_paging` | Bold first line, normal fonts for the other lines. If the data to be displayed doesn't fit on a single screen, the user will be able to navigate through different screens to see the whole text. | `bnnn_paging, {.title = "BoldLine", .text = "NormalLine"}` |

**Most commonly used layouts**

Here is a table that compares how those layouts are displayed on a Nano S and on a Nano X or S Plus.

Notice that the **Nano X and S Plus can fit up to 4 lines**, whereas the **Nano S can only fit 2**.
