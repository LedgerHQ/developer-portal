# Process

## 1. Adapt your app

These are all the steps you need to do to port your Nano App to Ledger Stax devices:

- Create icons in 32\*32px and 64\*64px. [Read more](../deliverables/icons/).
- Update your Makefile for Ledger Stax Specific defines (check the [app-boilerplate repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)). You should look at:
	- `ICONNAME`
	- BLE: Same `AppFlags`, defines and `SDK_SOURCE_PATH` as for NanoX
	- UX sdk lib and defines
- Update `io_event()` to handle `SEPROXYHAL_TAG_FINGER_EVENT`
- In `main()`, make sure to call `os_setting_get(OS_SETTING_PLANEMODE, NULL, 0)` and `BLE_power()` depending on `ifdef HAVE_BLE` so that Stax is included.
- Create new UX flow for Stax using NBGL library. Make sure to follow the design guidelines. [Read more](./ledger-stax-display/home/).
- Use the [Ledger framework](../quickstart/framework/) to:
	- test your build
	- add CI tests
	- add functional tests with Ragger
