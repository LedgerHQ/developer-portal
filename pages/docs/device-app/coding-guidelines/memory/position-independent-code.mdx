# Position-Independent Code

## PIC and Model Implications

PIC stands for Position-Independent Code. The BOLOS toolchain produces PIC to allow the code **Link address** to be different from the code **Execution address**. For example, the `main` function is linked in the generated application at address `0xC0D00000`. However, the slot used when loaded into the Secure Element could be `0x10E40400`. Therefore, if the code makes a reference to `0xC0D00000`, even with an offset, it would be denied access as the application is locked by the Memory Protection Unit (not to mention, this is not the correct address of the `main` function at runtime).

The PIC assembly generator makes sure every dereference is relative to the Program Counter, and never to an arbitrary address resolved during the link stage. This behaviour is supported by clang versions 4.0.0 and later.

Traditionally, PIC code implies the BSS segment (RAM variables) is at a constant offset of the code. For example, if code is at `0xC0D00000`, then global vars may be at `0xC2D00000`, so if loaded at `0x10E00000` then global vars would be at `0x12E00000`. However, BOLOS uses a fixed address for global vars. The global variables start address and length are defined in the link script. Only the code is meant to be placed at different addresses (in flash memory, rather than RAM).

The model we choose has limitations, which are related to the way `const` data and code is referenced in other `const` data. Here is a simple example:

``` c copy
const char array1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
const char array2[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
const char *array_2d[] = {array1, array2};

void main() {
    int sum, i, j;
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            sum += array_2d[i][j]; // Segmentation Fault!
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, when dereferencing `array_2d`, the compiler uses a link-time address (in the `0xC0D00000` space, following the previous examples). This is not where the program is loaded in memory at runtime. Therefore, when the dereference is executed, it causes a segmentation fault that effectively stalls the SE. Luckily, the solution is pretty simple, thanks to a small piece of assembly provided with the SDKs which is invoked with the `PIC(...)` macro. `PIC(...)` uses the current load address to adjust the link-time address in order to acquire the correct runtime address of `const` data and code. The above examples can be corrected by modifying the line where `array_2d` is dereferenced to do the following:

``` c copy
sum += ((const char*) PIC(array_2d[i]))[j];
```

The same mechanism must be applied when storing function pointers in `const` data. The PIC call cast is just different. Additionally, if a non-link-time address is passed to `PIC(...)`, it will be preserved. This is possible due to the wisely chosen link-time address which is beyond both real RAM and loadable addresses. For example, `PIC(...)` is used during a call to `io_seproxyhal_display_default(...)`, all display elements can hold a reference to a string to be displayed with the element, and the string could be in RAM or code, and therefore `PIC(...)` is applied to acquire the correct runtime address of the string, even if it's in RAM.
