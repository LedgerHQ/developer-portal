# Global architecture

Let’s see the typical end-to-end architecture of a Ledger OS application, in the case of an app for a cryptocurrency:

Three pieces of software are required:
- A Ledger OS application, written in C, running on a Ledger device
- The wallet app with business logic and typically a GUI, running on a computer or a phone connected to the Ledger device
- A <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> explorer that interfaces between the front-end and the <Glossary word="cryptocurrency"></Glossary> daemon, running either locally (in the case of a full node) or remotely (light wallet)

If you’re not developing an app adding support for a <Glossary word="cryptocurrency"></Glossary>, then you can ignore the 3rd piece. Depending on your use case, the wallet app might be a simple daemon or a command line tool, without a GUI.

The Ledger Manager is the service which centralizes the distribution of [Ledger OS](./ledger-os/introduction) applications on Ledger devices. It is the place where both Ledger’s apps and third party apps are distributed to users.
