# How the submission of an app goes?

## Release types

There are different release types for an application:

-   **Developer mode release**  
-   **Public release** (official Ledger support)  

An application can go through Ledger acceptance several times, according to release type.


<Callout type="info" emoji="👉">
  Until the application is audited, the message <code>Pending Ledger Review</code> is displayed when the application is used. The user must acknowledge this warning by pressing both buttons to use the application, which is at their own risk. 
</Callout>

Developer mode applications are considered experimental and such application will be visible **only when the [developer mode](../../../docs/discover/developer-mode) setting is enabled** in Ledger Live settings.

<Callout type="info" emoji="👉">
  Some applications are only visible if developer mode is enabled because they are considered too complex to use, not because they lack a security review. For example, the mandatory compatible wallet may be missing a GUI, or perhaps the application is considered too technical for the majority of users.
