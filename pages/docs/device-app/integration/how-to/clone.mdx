# Clone Applications

### What is a clone?

A variant, or clone, device app is developed when all the logic for signing transactions can be contained in the parent coin Device Application.

As for any Device Application, you must follow our guidelines to comply with Ledger publication requirements.

On this page you will find the information for Bitcoin and Ethereum clones.

## Bitcoin clones

Depending on your use case, the process will vary.

### A - Standard Bitcoin clone

If you want to create a new bitcoin clone without new features, instead of forking the boilerplate app you should fork [app-bitcoin-clone-boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-clone-boilerplate).

If your Bitcoin clone was included in the Bitcoin Device App and you need to update it, you should
create a new application by forking [app-bitcoin-clone-boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-clone-boilerplate).

You can then add your icon, customize the makefile, update the README, add your tests, make sure
your CI is green and you should be good to go !

Note that all APDU handlers have been defined with `WEAK` attribute, so they can be overwritten if your app requires you to do so.

### B - Bitcoin extension clone

If you want to implement smart contracts or layer 2 solutions on Bitcoin, instead of forking the boilerplate app you should fork [app-btcext-boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-btcext-boilerplate).

Once forked, you can add your icon, customize the makefile and hooks, update the README, and include your tests. Ensure your CI passes successfully, and you'll be ready to proceed!


## Ethereum clones

Depending on your derivation path, the process will vary.

### A - Using the 44/60 path

#### Prerequisites

Follow this process if your chain uses the 44/60 path.

#### Start here

Instead of building your application in a separate repository, you will make changes to the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum).

- Fork the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum)
- Before committing your changes remember to sign your commits.
- Please make your changes to the `develop` branch

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For security reasons, the repository is set up to accept only pull requests with signed commits. To sign your commits, use the -S flag : <code>$ git commit -S -m your commit message</code>
</Callout>

#### 1. Modify app-ethereum/src_common/network.c

Add your chain ID, chain name and Ticker to [network.c](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/blob/develop/src/network.c) following this example:

```js copy
{.chain_id = 592, .name = "Astar", .ticker = "ASTR"},
```

#### 2. Add an icon for Ledger Stax

Add your 64x64px gif icon in the `glyphs` folder following this naming convention: `chain_yourchainid_64px.gif`.
Use the template provided [here](../../submission-process/deliverables/icons#stax-template).

#### 3. Add your Network to Chainlist.org

Click "Add Your Network +" on [the Chainlist homepage](https://chainlist.org/) and follow the ReadMe to add your Network.


#### 4. Open a pull request

When your application is ready, open a pull request on the Ethereum application repository.

Please get in touch with our team on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to get your PR reviewed.

### B - All other paths

Follow this process if your chain uses another path than 44/60.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If your chain does not use the `44/60` path, you won't be able to use Metamask with your device app.
</Callout>

#### Start here

Instead of building your application in a separate repository, you will make changes to the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum).

- Fork the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum)
- Before committing your changes remember to sign your commits.
- Please make your changes to the `develop` branch

The following page uses the Walton Chain as an example, please replace every `WaltonChain` occurence with the name of your coin and chain.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For security reasons, the repository is set up to accept only pull requests with signed commits. To sign your commits, use the -S flag : <code>$ git commit -S -m your commit message</code>
</Callout>

#### 1. Create a file in app-ethereum/makefile_conf/chain

Following the next example, add a `.mk` file in `app-ethereum/makefile_conf/chain`

``` c copy
APP_LOAD_PARAMS += --path "44'/999999'"
TICKER = "WTC"
CHAIN_ID = 15
APPNAME = "WaltonChain"
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
    It is necessary to choose a Derivation Path and a Chain ID specific to your network to prevent the risk of replay attack (Introduced by EIP155) that can happen when using the same Derivation Path ( m/44'/60'/0') and Chain ID as Ethereum. This could expose your users to loss of funds.<br/>
    You can either use the same Derivation Path but define a new chain ID (make sure this is not used by another network) or use slip44/BIP44 standard to reserve a dedicated coin type that will allow you to define a new derivation path.
</Callout>

#### 2. Upload your app's icons

- Add your 16x16px Nanos , 14x14px Nano S Plus / Nano X and 32x32 Stax gif icons in the `icons` folder following these naming conventions: `nanos_app_chain_yourchainid.gif`, `nanox_app_chain_yourchainid.gif`, `stax_app_chain_yourchainid.gif`
- Add your 64x64px gif icon in the `icons` folder following this naming convention: `stax_yourchainid_64px.gif`.
Use the template provided [here](../../submission-process/deliverables/icons).

#### 3. Build the application

To build the clone application, use the Ledger VSCode extension. [Follow the beginners' guide if you need help](../../beginner/vscode-extension).


#### 4. Add your Network to SLIP-0044

Open a PR to add your network [in this file](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)

#### 5. Open a pull request

When your application is ready, open a pull request on the Ethereum application repository.

Please get in touch with our team on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to get your PR reviewed.

## Publishing the application

If you want to publish a clone application, follow the process in [Publishing an application](../../submission-process/process).
