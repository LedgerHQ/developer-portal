# Ethereum plugins

The plugins are in the process of being replaced by [the ERC-7730 process](../../../clear-signing/understanding/what-is-it). However at the moment, some special cases still require an Ethereum Plugin.

If you are already in contact with Ledger and are required to develop a plugin, follow [this documentation](https://ethereum-plugin-sdk.ledger.com/).
