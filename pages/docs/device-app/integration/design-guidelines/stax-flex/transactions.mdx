# Signing transactions and messages

Signing transactions is the core function of Ledger’s hardware wallets, and probably a core function of your app too.

This chapter presents the expected user experience of <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary>, as well as the required UI elements to use when <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary>.

## Definitions

### Transactions, messages, and operations

Throughout the Ledger documentation, you’ll find references to signing “transactions” and “messages”. They are defined as:
- **a transaction** affects the state of a <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>, like sending Bitcoin or transferring an NFT on Polygon;
- **a message** is an off-chain payload that is signed and then either broadcasted later, bundled with another operation, or used for off-chain verification. This is typically encountered on EVM chains (e.g. EIP-191, EIP-712 such as permits, etc.).
- **an operation** is a generic term that can describe a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> or a message, and can be used as a generic fallback.

### Clear signing and blind signing

**“Clear signing”** transactions means that users fully understand what they’re signing. The <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> parameters must be presented in a complete and easy-to-understand way, so that the user’s consent is fully informed.

Thanks to the Secure Display of their Ledger device and Ledger’s cryptographic infrastructure, users have the guarantee that what they see is what they sign.

While this doesn’t always guarantee execution (which would require full smart contract audits, and more), <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary> is a must-have for security because it protects users against malware and man-in-the-middle attacks.

User experience greatly benefits from <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary> too, as only the relevant fields to review are presented (conciseness) and they are well formatted (clarity and protection from mistakes).

Because <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary> is crucial for security and user-friendliness, blind- signed transactions and messages must display a standard warning that asks for explicit user acknowledgement. This will be presented later in this section.


## Anatomy of a transaction

All transactions and messages must respect the following structure:

![Transaction Structure](/device-app/stax-flex-transaction-structure.png)

The double-sided arrows represent the ability for users to navigate back and forth within the operation. Navigation edge-cases are discussed in the later chapter “Advanced interactions”.

Here’s an illustration of this structure with the Bitcoin app on Ledger Flex: 

![Transaction Structure](/device-app/stax-flex-bitcoin-structure.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Users should be able to reject the operation at any time, if they see information they were not expecting. This can happen at every step, including the intent and signature.

	Do not change the default UI elements that display the “Reject” or “Cancel” buttons at the bottom of each step of the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary>.
</Callout>

In the next sections, we’ll go step by step over the different parts of a canonical <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary>.

## Loading transaction data

Most transactions and messages should feel instantaneous to load for users.

Sometimes though, the processing or data fetching durations might be noticeable. In these cases, use the standard loaders for Ledger Stax and Ledger Flex. As a rule of thumb, you can present the loader if the loading duration is 1 second or greater. Avoid showing the loader for only a few milliseconds, as the flashing may appear as a bug to users.

![Loading transaction](/device-app/stax-flex-loading.png)


## Intent: giving context and information to users

The <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> intent is the first page displayed to users. It is part of <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary> and shows crucial information
- **the nature of the operation:** <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> or message;
- **the chain(s) or network(s) involved;**
- **the type of the operation:** send, swap, delegate, approve, list NFT, etc. ;
- **and any other useful information** before getting into the detailed review of the fields.

The intent acts both as an informational step and a safety net, because users can reject the operation as soon as the prompt is displayed, without even reviewing the fields.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	When the intent appears, Ledger Stax and Ledger Flex play a sound to attracting the user’s attention to the device, where they’ll take action next. Keep this default behavior in your app unless you have a reason not to. And remember that users can disable sounds in the device settings.
</Callout>

Here are intent examples for different apps and operations.

![Intent examples](/device-app/stax-flex-intent-example-01.png)
|:--:| 
| *Intent examples, from left to right: Bitcoin transfer, NFT transfer on Polygon, and Ethereum Permit2 message.* |

Here are more intent examples from other chains:

![Intent examples](/device-app/stax-flex-intent-example-02.png)

When lacking information about the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> or message, use a generic intent as a fallback:

![Generic intant](/device-app/stax-flex-generic-intant.png)
|:--:| 
| *Generic, fallback intents (to avoid).* |

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	Avoid falling back to generic intents as much as possible, and always favor more information and context so that users clear sign with confidence, or reject if anything is different from what they expected.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The prompt sentence must start with “Review”. It is built either:
	<ul>
		<li>· dynamically, composing the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> type and other key informations;</li>
		<li>· or statically, by making a legible sentence with the available information for every <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> type.</li>
	</ul>
</Callout>

## Presenting transaction fields for review

Transaction fields must allow users to fully understand the operation they’re signing, while minimizing info that is not useful to their control or safety.

Transaction or message fields are always structured in the same way: rows of key-value pairs. You don’t have to do any UI work here, as the default layout will automatically take care of page construction and pagination.

![Layout differences](/device-app/stax-flex-layout-differences.png)
|:--:| 
| *Fields for a Bitcoin transfer, on Ledger Stax and Ledger Flex. Layout differences are taken care of automatically by the API.* |

Ensure consistency by presenting common fields in a consistent order. For simple transfers, this ish
1. “From” address
2. “Amount” (value and currency)
3. “To” addresOs
4. “Fees” (value and currency).
Here’s how the <Glossary word="Ethereum"></Glossary> app displays a transfer by following this guideline: 


![Ethereum transaction](/device-app/stax-flex-ethereum-transaction.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	<ul>
		<li>· Let your users navigate back and forth within transactions. Exceptions, such as streamed transactions, are discussed in a later chapter.</li>
		<li>· Pagination is automatically handled by the <Glossary word="API"></Glossary>, so you can just focus on providing your users with the right fields</li>
		<li>· Field names must be consistent and explicit. For example, use the term “To” over the generic “Address” to distinguish sender and receiver. Use “Amount” and “Fees” (or “Max fees”) consistently.</li>
	</ul>
</Callout>

## Signing a transaction

The signing page is always the last one because it ensures that your users went through all the critical fields they needed to review.

The signing page recalls the intent by presenting similar data, to bring up the context during signing.

Confirming a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> always uses the same press-and-hold gesture on the dedicated area of the screen: “Hold to sign”. After 2 seconds, the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> is signed and the user receives a success notification accompanied by a sound.

The notification dismisses automatically after a few seconds, and the user is back on your app’s home screen.

![Permit 2 signing with the Ethereum App](/device-app/stax-flex-permit2-ethereum.png)
|:--:| 
| *Signing a Bitcoin transfer with the Bitcoin app on Ledger Stax.* |

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	<ul>
		<li>· Stick to the default “Hold to sign” wording, as the Ledger device cannot know if the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> was properly transmitted to the software wallet and broadcasted on the <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>.</li>
		<li>· Similarly, stick to the default “Transaction signed” or “message signed” wording, as the Ledger device cannot know if the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> was successfully broadcasted.</li>
	</ul>
</Callout>

## Rejecting transaction

Rejecting a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> is a safety action that must be accessible at all times. Thus, this action always sits at the bottom of every screen, from the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> prompt to the signing step.

When users tap on “Reject transaction”, a confirmation modal asks them to confirm. This is to prevent accidental touches.

![Rejecting a transaction](/device-app/stax-flex-rejecting-transaction.png)


## Page grouping

To help your users navigate longer or more complex transactions, you might want to group several field pages into sections. You can achieve this by using divider pages, that simply show a section title and a section number:

![Page grouping](/device-app/stax-flex-page-grouping.png)
|:--:| 
| *Divider pages (first and last pages) to better organize a complex signing flow in the Stellar app.* |

## Blind signing

When a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> cannot be fully decoded, a standard “blind signing warning sequence” must be presented to users. It should be accompanied by a dedicated setting that the user must enable in order to sign non-decoded transactions or messages.

- The “blind signing” setting should be off by default. When that’s the case, the user is presented with a specific warning when trying to sign an non-decoded <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary>.
- After enabling the setting, users must still be warned of every blind <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary>.
- On the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> intent and signature pages, a warning icon is introduced. When tapped, it brings back the detailed risk review as a modal.

The example below shows a <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> sequence on Ledger Stax, where the <Glossary word="Ethereum"></Glossary> app presents the approval of an unknown ERC-20 token, and after the <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> setting was enabled:


![Stax Blind Signing](/device-app/stax-blind-signing-01.png)
|:--:| 
![Stax Blind Signing](/device-app/stax-blind-signing-02.png)
| *Note the null amount and lack of token info: the user cannot understand that they are signing a token approval in this example. The last screen is displayed when the user touches the warning icon in the top-right corner, displayed on the intent and signing pages.* |

If the “blind signing” setting is disabled, a dedicated warning message redirects the user when attempting to sign a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> that cannot be fully decoded:

![Flex Blind Signing](/device-app/flex-blind-signing.png)
|:--:| 
| *The term “transaction” must be replaced with “message” when relevant.* |

## Signing messages

While this whole chapter mainly focused on transactions, the same principles apply to messages. The wording must reflect this change by consistently replacing “transaction” with “message”.

When messages lack information about their type, structure, <Glossary word="blockchain"></Glossary>, or network, the prompt and signature screens must use this “scroll” icon:

![Review transaction](/device-app/stax-flex-review-transaction.png)

## Key takeaways

<KeyTakeaway>
	<ul>
		<li>· Rely on the default <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> structure and allow users to navigate freely within it. Use the default signing gesture and wording to make the experience consistent across all apps</li>
		<li>· Leverage the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> intent and the <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> fields to craft a great <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary> experience for your specific use cases, balancing complete user control with digestible information.</li>
		<li>· When <Glossary word="clear signing"></Glossary> is not possible, you must use the standard “Blind signing” warning template.</li>
		<li>· Refer to the “Advanced interactions” chapter if your app needs to handle special cases outside the high-level <Glossary word="API"></Glossary> “use case” functions.</li>
	</ul>
