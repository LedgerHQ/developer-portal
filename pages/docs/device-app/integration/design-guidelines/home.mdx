# App‚Äôs homepage

The homepage tells users what your app is about, and leads them to their next action. Most often, it‚Äôs creating a transaction in Ledger Live or another software wallet.

## Anatomy of the app's home

Your app‚Äôs home must show the app icon, name, and description.

The creation and positioning of these elements are taken care of automatically from your app‚Äôs assets, so you can focus on providing your users a helpful, concise description of what your app does.

  	<code>nbgl_useCaseHomeAndSettings()</code><br/>
  	This high-level API takes care of automatically building the app home, but also the settings and info (see next chapter). <a href="https://ledgerhq.github.io/ledger-secure-sdk/nbgl__use__case_8h.html#a438078d9be71706e0ad6a05f56658255">View API docs</a>.

The top-right icon is automatically set for you: a wheel if there are user- customizable settings, or an ‚Äúinfo‚Äù icon otherwise. Read the next chapter for details on settings.
