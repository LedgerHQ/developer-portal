## Application parameters: minimal and declared

Refer to [this section](../../references/app-permissions) for further information.


### App permissions

Every app must declare a set of permissions it needs to run properly. These permissions must be minimal, and be declared
not only in each app repository, but also listed  in the
[Ledger app database](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-database).

The coherence between these permissions and the app `Makefile` is verified as part of
[Ledger guidelines enforcer GitHub workflow](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-app-workflows),
[which is also a requirement](./development#workflows).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Ledger will not deploy an app if its permissions have not been registered in Ledger app database.
</Callout>

### Derivation path

The application derivation paths must be restricted to coin-specific BIP32 prefix, and declared in the
[Ledger app database](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-database).

The coherence between these derivation path and the app `Makefile` is verified as part of
[Ledger guidelines enforcer GitHub workflow](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-app-workflows),
[which is also a requirement](./development#workflows).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Ledger will not deploy an app if its derivation paths have not been registered in Ledger app database.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Ledger will not deploy apps whose BIP32 prefixes have not been properly set.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If your application derives keys on the hardened path 44'/60' then the chainID parameter must be different from 0 or 1. This is necessary to avoid replaying transactions broadcoast on Ethereum-like chains on Ethereum. As a general recommendation, and to ensure a good level of privacy for the end user, we recommend to always use the correct coin type in the derivation path as defined in <a href='https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md' className='alert-link'> slip44 </a>

## Signing settings

### Signing

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  All signing transactions/messages action must ask for the user approval before happening.
</Callout>

More information [here](../../explanation/cryptography#signingdisclosing-keys).


### Blind Signing

As a general rule, [blind signing should be avoided](../../explanation/cryptography#avoid-blindly-signing-data), however it is tolerated under some circumstances.


For every transaction, the users must be able to verify on the device the amount being transferred and the destination address or the validator/nominator address(es) in the case of a staking operation, and the fees being paid.

When the display of those parameters (Token, smart contract management) is not possible, the transaction should be rejected by the device unless the user has acknowledged that they will be blind signing.

To implement this requirement it is recommended to have a setting menu with the possibility to enable/disable blind signing.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    If blind signing is implemented, it must be **disabled** by default.
</Callout>


You can find implementation example inside [Ethereum](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum) code base.

## CodeQL

[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/) is required to perform security checks and detect vulnerabilities.
It can be directly integrated into your project by creating a new YAML file: `.github/workflows/codeql-workflow.yaml` in your repository.

A complete [codeql-workflow.yml](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/0cdb0059e4f374b796b25ed347202c5e4e3e558a/.github/workflows/codeql-workflow.yml) file is available in the repository of the Boilerplate app.

The first part of the file is an initialization of what is needed to build your Ledger app and a declaration of languages used in your code so CodeQL analyzes it in the right way.

```yaml copy
jobs:
  analyse:
    name: Analyse
    strategy:
      matrix:
        sdk: ["$NANOX_SDK", "$NANOSP_SDK", "$STAX_SDK", "$FLEX_SDK"]
        language: [ 'cpp' ]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/ledgerhq/ledger-app-builder/ledger-app-builder-legacy:lite
```

The action part needs 4 steps:

- Clone your repository
- Initialize CodeQL:
  - Declaration of which languages are used and the chosen queries. Please choose the `security-and-quality` queries.
- Build the app. Be careful : the initialization of CodeQL needs to be done before building the app so that CodeQL makes the code dictionary during the building stage.
- Perform the CodeQL analysis

```yaml copy
steps:
  - name: Clone
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      submodules: true

  - name: Initialize CodeQL
    uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
    with:
      languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
      queries: security-and-quality

  - name: Build
    run: |
      make BOLOS_SDK=${{ matrix.sdk }}

  - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
    uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

Next the results of CodeQL are displayed on your GitHub security view, in the “Code scanning alerts” panel. If CodeQL is configured to run when a pull request (PR) on some branches is made, the results will also be shown in the “Checks” parts of the PR.

The security issues with a severity level higher than low must be fixed before going through the security audit. The quality issues with a level set to error must also be fixed.
