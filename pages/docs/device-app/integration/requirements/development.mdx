# Development

## Workflows

Ledger provides [reusable workflows running on GitHub actions](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-app-workflows), which
builds, analyzes or tests the code, checks the application's metadata and more. Some of these workflows are mandatory.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    <ul>
        <li>
            The following workflows are required on every <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> repository, and must run without error.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ledger will not deploy an application if these workflows are not integrated and green.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>


- The [guidelines enforcer workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/reusable_guidelines_enforcer.yml)
  (example its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/guidelines_enforcer.yml))
- The [build workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/reusable_build.yml)
  (example of its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml#L21-L25))


## Manifest

Some high-level application metadata must be declared in a `ledger_app.toml` <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> file, stored at the root of the
application repository.

The format of this manifest is described [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgered/blob/master/doc/utils/manifest.md),
along with the tool which can be used to check the validity of the <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary>.
You can also use [the manifest in Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/ledger_app.toml)
as a living example

Most of our workflows (including the mandatory ones) use this <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> to infer environment data (like the <Glossary word="SDK"></Glossary> language,
or the build directory) so the validity of the <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary> can be checked through these.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Ledger will not deploy an application without a correct `ledger_app.toml` <Glossary word="manifest"></Glossary>.
</Callout>


## Tests

The application repository must have a `tests` folder that contains at least functional tests using the
[Speculos](../../references/tools#speculos) emulator. These tests must be triggered by the CI and running without error.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Ledger will not deploy an application without tests or with failing tests.
</Callout>

For Python tests, Ledger provides the [`Ragger` library](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ragger), which can be easily
integrated with `Pytest` in the GitHub action with the [Ragger workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/reusable_ragger_tests.yml)
(example of its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml#L27-L32))

Unit tests are highly recommended, especially for critical functions like parsers - preferably relying on a standard framework like [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/). These tests must be automated using GitHub actions the [unit tests workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/unit_tests.yml) of the Boilerplate application can act as a reference.


## Nice to have

On top of that, we also encourage the following practices:

- Linting helps improving code quality and ensuring consistent coding style and resolving basic coding errors.
- Developing a fuzzer (example of its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/tree/master/fuzzing)).
- <Glossary word="Integration"></Glossary> with the Coverity static code analysis tool helps finding security issues and software defects.
