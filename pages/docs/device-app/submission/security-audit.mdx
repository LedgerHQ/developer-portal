# Security Audits

## Introduction

To be listed on the Ledger Live “My Ledger“ section, Device Apps and Plugins must go through our integration process that includes a security audit performed by one of our trusted partners. 

Provided your project fulfills the [conditions](#conditions), this is how an external audit unfolds:
1. You get in touch with the auditers and sign a contract with them. [Read more](#your-agreement-with-our-partners).
2. The auditors review your app based on Ledger specifications. [Read more](#content-of-the-security-audit).
3. Ledger reviews the security audit report
4. Ledger publishes your app

## Conditions

To go through an external security audit, ensure your project fulfills the following conditions:

- Your Embedded App works with all our devices (Ledger Nano S, S Plus, X and Stax)
- Your Embedded App has been functionally validated by Ledger team

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    <ul>
        <li>Do not start a security audit process if your Embedded App is not ready for all Ledger devices (Ledger Nano S, S Plus, X and Stax).</li>
        <li>Your Embedded App must still be functional after the security audit </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>

## Your agreement with our partners

If your embedded app is ready to go through the security audit, you can contact one of our partners:

- [Kudelski IoT]( https://www.kudelski-iot.com/services-and-systems/ledger-security-audit).
- [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/), contact them [here](mailto:qb_ledger@quarkslab.com).

They both follow Ledger specifications and will provide a full report with potential vulnerabilites.

Important aspects of your agreement:
- Time: When the auditors will be able to start the review.
- Cost: The external audit will be entirely at your expense.
- Maintenance: You must include a clause for updates or sign a new contract for any major update. If you don't, your app will not be updated by Ledger and will be reverted to developer mode if it is breaking.

## Content of the security audit

Ledger has established and made public a detailed specification of what needs to be done to perform a security audit following Ledger’s standards. 

|          Step          |         Specification                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application privileges | Check application flags (privileges) and allowed derivation paths. |
| Compilation            | Check for compilation warnings, and if warnings have been silenced. If so, ask for a fix. |
| Tests                  | Run tests and check they succeed / Check tests are sound.           |
| Static Analysis        | Check for defects using scan-build and our scan options. Add in CI if not present / CodeQL: check with the "security and quality" queries. Add in CI if not present. |
| Manual code review     | List every transaction fields. Look which ones must be displayed to the user / Check transaction parser, field formatters / Check if sensitive data is properly erased / Do not allow blind signing. |
| Fuzzing                | Implement a transaction fuzzer. Best effort to reach decent coverage / Use libFuzzer if possible to integrate with ClusterFuzzLite. |
| Deliverables           | Report and executive summary detailing findings, and tests that gave no results / Security fixes: on a temporary private fork / Feedback on the SDK: what could be improved for a better security. |


## Security Guidelines

To develop a secure embedded app, read and apply [the security guidelines](../coding-guidelines/secure-app/).
