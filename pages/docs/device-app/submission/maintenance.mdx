# App updates

Here, you have already submitted an embedded app and you want to update for your community. 

Ledger will not update your embedded app code, you are responsible for all subsequent updates following the initial release. 

Since Ledger will not update your embedded app code, you are responsible for all subsequent updates following the initial release. This means that updates must be submitted for 
- functional tests, and
- a  [Security Audit](./security-audit/) 

Afterwards you will submit a new form where you can pick and choose the parts of the App that have been updated.

The form must be submitted for all types of releases (developer mode and public releases).

Please [fill in this form](https://ledger.typeform.com/app-submission) for any updates to your embedded app code.

To have your application updates released on time, we recommend you inform Ledger as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.

Looking forward to see your updates on "My Ledger" in Ledger Live!
