# Ethereum plugins

## Why plugins?

Plugins display specific smart contracts information to the users to avoid blind signing. They work hand-in-hand with the Ethereum App.

The Ethereum App handles parsing, signing, screen display etc. The only thing your plugin needs to do is:

1. Extract the relevant information from the data.
2. Send the string to be displayed back to the Ethereum App.
