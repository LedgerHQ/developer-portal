# Printf

The firmware supports the `PRINTF` macro debugging feature, which is defined it in the Makefile.  
```
DEFINES += HAVE_SPRINTF HAVE_PRINTF PRINTF=screen_printf
```

You can use PRINTF with [the Speculos emulator](./speculos).

Usually, `PRINTF` is defined as void, with this line `DEFINES += PRINTF\(...\)=`.  
Check if `PRINTF` is already defined somewhere in your Makefile, and if so, comment out this definition so it doesn't override.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The <code>PRINTF</code> macro is a debugging feature, it must not  be used in production. <br/>When compiling an application for release, please check that <code>PRINTF</code> is disabled in the Makefile: <br/>insert the line <code>DEFINES += PRINTF\(...\)=</code> and comment out the other one.
