# Manage your device with ledgerctl

## Installation

### 1. Install ledgerctl

Run:

```bash copy
pip3 install --upgrade protobuf setuptools ecdsa
pip3 install ledgerwallet
```

And:
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl.git
pip3 install --upgrade protobuf setuptools ecdsa
cd ledgerctl
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Install a custom certificate authority (optional)

Optionally, install a custom certificate authority (this will help to establish a custom secure channel between the computer and the device, and identifies ledgerctl as a "trusted manager" on the device):

- a. To install a custom CA, boot the device in "Recovery" mode by pressing the right button at boot time.
- b. Then run `ledgerctl install-ca <NAME>` where `<NAME>` is the name that will be displayed on the device to identify the CA. It can be any label, like "ledgerctl", "Dev", or "CA". 

The Ledger device will display to you a public key. Allow the “unsafe manager” on the device by pressing at the time the right and left buttons. 

## Usage

You’re now ready to use ledgerctl to manage your Nano. 

To display the list of the application installed on your device:
```bash copy
ledgerctl list 
```

To display the available space on the device:
```bash copy
ledgerctl meminfo
```

To delete an app (for example “Bitcoin Legacy”):
```bash copy
ledgerctl delete "Bitcoin Legacy"
```
