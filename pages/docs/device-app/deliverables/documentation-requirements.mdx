# Documentation

The requirement is to document your app's **APDUs** and **status words** on the app's repository (A)  
and to submit the **user's documentation** in a Google Doc format for review or a **URL** to the already published documentation (B).  
If it is already published, ensure it follows the instructions below.

## A. APDUs and Status words

Your embedded app repository must have a `docs` folder in which you will document the APDUs and corresponding errors, taking example on the [Bitcoin App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/blob/develop/doc/bitcoin.md).

For the ranges available, follow the stated ranges in the [SDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/blob/master/include/errors.h).

Name this file `apdu.md` and put it under the `docs` folder of your app. 


## B. Users documentation

### Introduction

Documentation is important for the Approval of your app, as your app will not be released without it.

It is required for third party teams to provide and host a complete tutorial for users before the app is released on the Ledger Manager. Here are the rules for writing this documentation and it should be followed very carefully.

### Ledger Documentation

Your documentation must follow the requirements below  so that Ledger uses a solid common documentaion basis.
[Ledger Customer Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us) will write and publish an article ([example](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007583514-Ontology-ONT-)) that describes:
- Short introduction: what the app does, what crypto assets it can manage, using what service. Who has developed it. Ledger Nano S, Nano X and Nano S Plus supported?
- Requirements: What’s needed before starting.
- Installation instructions: How to install the app using Ledger Live.
- Next steps: link to third party documentation and where to get support.
