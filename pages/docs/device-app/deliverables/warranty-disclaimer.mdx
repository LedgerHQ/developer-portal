## Disclaimer

The publication of a third party developed application (an “App”) on Ledger Manager (the “Service”) is supported by Ledger on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis. Ledger does not warrant that the Service will be accurate, error-free or uninterrupted. Ledger disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of accuracy, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose in respect of the Service. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, in no event will Ledger be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, data, business or goodwill or business interruption. 

As part of the onboarding process, Ledger may conduct a technical review of your App to identify bugs or other faults. This technical review does not constitute a vetting or endorsement of the App by Ledger, nor does it create any kind of partnership between you and Ledger or limit your responsibility for your App. Ledger shall not be responsible or liable for any damages caused to any third parties by your App.

The Service, Ledger software, firmware and hardware are subject to change without notice, which may require that you perform an update on your App at your own cost to ensure ongoing compatibility with Ledger software, firmware, hardware products and the Service. Please keep yourself informed of such changes by following the relevant developer channel on Discord.
As an App developer, you assume total responsibility and risks for your use of the Service and any damage that your application may cause to third parties or to Ledger. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, all the necessary steps to maintain the continuity of the availability and the performance of the App you have developed and submitted to the Service. You shall, at all times and at your own cost, regularly test and update the App you have developed in order for your App to be fully functional with the latest Ledger updates and plugins, as well as, mitigate all risks and incidents that may affect your App, or the use of your App by any third party.

By submitting the App to the Service, you warrant that your App will not cause any fault or malfunction in any software, firmware, hardware or network and information system, nor shall introduce any viruses or vulnerabilities onto the Services. You warrant that the App will operate in accordance with Ledger and user expectations and that the maintenance of your App will be of satisfactory quality and conform to the requirements to function with the Service, Ledger software, firmware and hardware.
The App you submit must be distributed under an open source license. You warrant that your submission of an App is not in breach of any third party’s intellectual property or other rights and you agree to indemnify and hold Ledger harmless in case of a claim brought by a third party against Ledger regarding the application you have submitted. You warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all permissions, licences and consents necessary to provide the App. You are also responsible for ensuring that your App is not in breach of any laws and regulations and that its distribution by Ledger will not expose Ledger to a breach of export controls regulations.

As part of the submission of your App to the Service, you will be required to provide personal information such as your name, country of residence, etc. This information will be processed in accordance with Ledger’s privacy policy and may be communicated to users in Ledger Live, in particular where and when the disclosure of this information to the users is a legal requirement.
Ledger reserves the right to reject the publication of an App or to remove it from Ledger Live at its sole discretion and without providing any justification.

By publishing an App, you are giving Ledger the right to communicate about the said App. Ledger will use its discretion as to whether or not to communicate on the release of a new App and the way it communicates.
Nothing will impair Ledger’s right to develop, promote or distribute applications that perform the same or similar functions or achieve the same result as the App you have submitted for publication.
