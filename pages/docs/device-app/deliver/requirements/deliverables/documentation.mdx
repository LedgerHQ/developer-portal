# Documentation

The requirement is to document your app's **APDUs** and **status words** on the app's repository (A)  
and to submit the **user's documentation** in a Google Doc format for review or a **URL** to the already published documentation (B).  
If it is already published, ensure it follows the instructions below.

## A. APDUs and Status words

Your embedded app repository must have a `docs` folder in which you will document the APDUs and corresponding errors, taking example on the [Bitcoin App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/blob/develop/doc/bitcoin.md).

For the ranges available, follow the stated ranges in the [SDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/blob/master/include/errors.h).

Name this file `apdu.md` and put it under the `docs` folder of your app. 


## B. Users documentation

### Introduction

Documentation is important for the Approval of your app, as your app will not be released without it.

It is required for third party teams to provide and host a complete tutorial for users before the app is released on the Ledger Manager. Here are the rules for writing this documentation and it should be followed very carefully.

  Without approval of your documentation, your app will not be released.

### Ledger Documentation

Your documentation must follow the requirements below  so that Ledger uses a solid common documentaion basis.
[Ledger Customer Support](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us) will write and publish an article ([example](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007583514-Ontology-ONT-)) that describes:
- Short introduction: what the app does, what crypto assets it can manage, using what service. Who has developed it. Ledger Nano S, Nano X and Nano S Plus supported?
- Requirements: What’s needed before starting.
- Installation instructions: How to install the app using Ledger Live.
- Next steps: link to third party documentation and where to get support.


### Content

The article ([example](https://blog.cyberrepublic.org/2020/06/15/how-to-use-your-ledger-device-with-the-elastos-light-wallet/)) must describe:
- Short introduction: what the app and service do, what crypto assets they can manage, why to use a Ledger device, where to get support.
- Requirements: What’s needed before starting.

- Support: where to get help if needed (mail address, Slack/Reddit/Telegram communities). 
- Since you will host the final version of the document you are required to prepare the URL address and include it clearly in the Google Doc.

### Style

- Write short and concise sentences.

<i>Strictly avoid: wallet, Ledger wallet, a Ledger</i>.
- **Referring to crypto assets**: name, ticker, crypto asset(s), coin(s), cryptocurrency.
