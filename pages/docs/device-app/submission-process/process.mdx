# How the submission of an app goes?

## Development and submission phases

### 1. Make sure your app followed the coding requirements

For an app to be deployed, it must comply with a list of requirements, which are expressed in [Security](../integration/requirements/security), [Cryptography](../integration/requirements/cryptography) and [Developement](../integration/requirements/development) requirements documentation.

### 2. Make sure you have all the deliverables ready

For an app to be deployed, you must provide a list of deliverables, which are detailed in the next section.

### 3. Fill in the submission form

When your app or plugin and deliverables are ready, [fill in the submission form](./submission-form).

### Disclaimer

Ledger's release of a third party application must not be considered as any form of partnership or endorsement.

## Release flow

This process is applicable to first submissions and to App updates.

## Application repository flow

To be able to deploy an application (and sometimes test or apply modifications), Ledger will fork the application's repository.

Our fork will have its own Git flow, which will help us keep track of what code is deployed in production or not, through branches and tags.

Basically, all of the work and PR is made into or against a `develop` branch. Ledger will also deploy application from develop to specific, test providers (number 4 except for Stax application which usually are deployed on 12).

This application will not be available for most Ledger Live users which use the default, production provider (number 1),
but it is available for anyone changing the provider number ("Settings > Experimental features > My Ledger provider"),
so that it allows real-life testing and qualification.

Further fixes or modification before the application is deemed ready will be merged from the developer's repository into this `develop` branch.
