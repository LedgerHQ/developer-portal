# App maintenance

Here, you have already submitted a <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> and you want to update for your community.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
   As a developer, you are responsible for all subsequent updates following the initial release of your <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> or plugin on Ledger.
</Callout>

Application updates must be submitted alongside:
- functional tests, and
- a  [Security Audit](./deliverables/security-audit)

Afterwards you will submit a new form where you can pick and choose the parts of the App that have been updated.

Please [fill in this form](./submission-form) for any updates to your device app code or [this one](https://ledger.typeform.com/to/YZZCHEB8) for an update of a plugin.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
   To ensure your application updates are released on time, inform Ledger as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.
</Callout>

Looking forward to see your updates on "My Ledger" in Ledger Live!
