# Support

The requirement is for you to **ensure support** for all users for your application.
You must state **how** users will obtain support as described below.

Ledger does not provide support for third party applications. Third party teams must host a complete tutorial to guide users before the app is released on  "My Ledger" in Ledger Live. Please follow the [documentation requirements](./documentation).

Along with your tutorial, please provide information that will allow the Ledger support team to redirect users to relevant support resources:
- URL
- email address
- phone number
- ...

If you use community channels for support, you must ensure that it is moderated.
