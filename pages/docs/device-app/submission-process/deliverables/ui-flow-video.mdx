# Demo

You are required to submit a video demo of your <Glossary word="Device App"></Glossary> as described below (For Ledger Nano only).

## UI Flows

To create the flow you will show in the video, we recommend you follow the UI flows shown below.

### Send and receive examples

Please create your flow following the given [Ethereum example](/device-app/eth-flow.pdf).

It contains the basic functions App information, Receive and send operations. Include the main operations that your <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> contains. Try to apply the same kind of flow design for all of them.

### Blind signing

In case you need the users to blind sign transactions, you will need to include the <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> flows.

- This screen should be displayed when <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> is not enabled and the user wants to sign a <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> requiring blind signing:

<br/>
<div className="center">
	<img src="/device-app/blind-signing-not-enabled.png" alt="Blind signing not enabled"/>
</div>

- How to modify the <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> settings:

- When <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> is enabled:

## Video

You must **create your own video** using the example given.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pgGZvx30yNw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


On the video demo you must show on a real device how to:
- Import account
- Verify address
- Accept / reject a coin transfer transaction
- Show settings

If applicable :
- Transfer a token
- Delegate/Stake/Vote

If <Glossary word="blind signing"></Glossary> is implemented:
- Sign a blind signed <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> while setting is disabled
- Sign a blind signed <Glossary word="transaction"></Glossary> while setting is enabled

*Reminder : Blind signed operations must only be accessible behind a setting that must be disabled by default ([see blind signing section](../../integration/requirements/security#blind-signing))*
