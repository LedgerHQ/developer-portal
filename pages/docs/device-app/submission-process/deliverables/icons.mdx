# Icons

The requirement is to provide 2 mandatory icons that should be provided for Ledger to release an app:

-   The Manager icon, displayed in the Manager application list in Ledger Live
-   The Device icon, displayed on the Ledger dashboard (this consists in 1 icon for the Nano S, one Icon for the Nano S Plus and the Nano X, and one for the Ledger Stax)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Submitting icons that are not compliant will slow down the process of publishing your device App.
