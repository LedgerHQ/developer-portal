# Embedded Tools


## `Speculos`

`Speculos` is an emulator allowing to run and test an device application without loading it on a physical Ledger
device. While it is not capable of emulating some constraints of the physical devices, it is still a very realistic
and handy tool, and the pillar of any credible testing strategy.

<Callout type="info">
    If you need more information about `Speculos`, read [its documentation](https://speculos.ledger.com/). <br/>
    Sources can be found [here](https://github.com/ledgerhq/speculos).
</Callout>

## `Ragger`

`Ragger` is Python library offering abstractions over an Ledger embedded device (Nano and Stax), either real or emulated
(through `Speculos`). It aims at simplifying writing generic communication with an device application and managing
high-level graphical interactions. It is widly used to write functional tests code


<Callout type="info">
    You can read the full Ragger documentation [here](https://ledgerhq.github.io/ragger/). <br/>

## Ledgered

Ledgered is a Python package which goal is to be a collection of small, autonomous utilitaries and libraries.

For now, it only contains a tool (`ledger-manifest`) allowing to check `ledger_app.toml` manifest files (which are a
[requirement](../deliver/requirements/development#manifest) for an application to be deployed).

<Callout type="info">
    Sources and documentation can be found [in the Ledgered repository](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledgered).

## Ledgerblue

In Ledger app development, it is necessary to enter your PIN code each time you install an unsigned app. However, BOLOS supports installing a custom developer certificate. With a custom certificate, you can avoid having to retype your PIN each time you adjust your app. Here are the steps for the Ledger Nano S:

1.  Generate a public / private keypair using the following command:
        ``` console copy
        foo@bar:~$ python3 -m ledgerblue.genCAPair
        Public key : 0495331cb86e961fc9cb5792a97737e4204b58be99321dcec463cec3057b3304e9875614004e6e540ab0610a1339fae22df6f6f3ec594912b409d69b72f0eaf390
        Private key: 6c1f1df852255e113b23c2e977d6b5c3ea2aaf411f05a5fdab87a3e8f44468ee
        ```

2. Enter in recovery mode on your Ledger Nano S. Do this by unplugging it then holding down the right button (near the hinge, away from USB port) while plugging it in again. `recovery mode` should then appear on the screen. Enter your pin and continue.

3. Load your public key onto the Ledger Nano S. Paste the public key generated at step 1 after `--public`. You may need to adjust the `--targetId` constant to match your device. Find the right targetId for your device [here](https://gist.github.com/TamtamHero/b7651ffe6f1e485e3886bf4aba673348). Notice that we must include a `--name` parameter containing the name of the custom certificate (any string will do):

        python3 -m ledgerblue.setupCustomCA --targetId 0x31100004 --public yourPublicKey --name dev

    If you receive the error `Invalid status 6985`, review [this link](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python/issues/42) and go back to step 2. The above command is the simplest that can work however some developers may wish to use the optional `--rootPrivateKey` option to specify a secure channel encryption key (which is the private key generated at step 1) or use the `--name` option for convenient labeling according to local convention.

4. Once you have loaded your custom certificate, load an app you compiled onto your Ledger device to see if you are able to bypass the PIN. Before you try it, set the `SCP_PRIVKEY` environment variable to contain the private key generated at step 1 in your shell or `.bashrc`:

        export SCP_PRIVKEY=yourPrivateKey

    and rebuild/load your app.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  A Ledger device with a custom CA installed can not pass the Ledger Genuine Check, which is required to install applications from the Ledger Live. To make it pass the check, uninstall your custom CA and all the applications installed through it.
</Callout>

**Uninstalling a custom CA is very quick:**

1. Enter in recovery mode on your Ledger Nano S: unplug the device and then plug it back while holding down the right button (near the hinge, away from USB port). `recovery mode` appears on the screen. Enter your pin and continue.

2.  Type this command in your terminal:
        ``` bash copy
        foo@bar:~$ python3 -m ledgerblue.resetCustomCA --targetId 0x31100004
        ```
    Find the right targetId for your device [here](https://gist.github.com/TamtamHero/b7651ffe6f1e485e3886bf4aba673348).


## Ledgerctl

<Callout type="info">
    The sources of this too can be found [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl).
</Callout>

### Installation

#### Install Ledgerctl

Run:

```bash copy
pip3 install --upgrade protobuf setuptools ecdsa
pip3 install ledgerwallet
```

And:
```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl.git
pip3 install --upgrade protobuf setuptools ecdsa
cd ledgerctl
pip install -e .
```

#### (optional) Install a custom certificate authority

Optionally, install a custom certificate authority (this will help to establish a custom secure channel between the computer and the device, and identifies ledgerctl as a "trusted manager" on the device):

- a. To install a custom CA, boot the device in "Recovery" mode by pressing the right button at boot time.
- b. Then run `ledgerctl install-ca <NAME>` where `<NAME>` is the name that will be displayed on the device to identify the CA. It can be any label, like "ledgerctl", "Dev", or "CA".

The Ledger device will display to you a public key. Allow the “unsafe manager” on the device by pressing at the time the right and left buttons.

### Usage

You’re now ready to use ledgerctl to manage your Nano.

To display the list of the application installed on your device:
```bash copy
ledgerctl list
```

To display the available space on the device:
```bash copy
ledgerctl meminfo
```

To delete an app (for example “Bitcoin Legacy”):
```bash copy
ledgerctl delete "Bitcoin Legacy"
```
