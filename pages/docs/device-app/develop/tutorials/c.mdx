# The `C` boilerplate application

The `C` Boilerplate application (which is the default Boilerplate application, contrary to the much more recent `Rust`
Boilerplate application) is taylored to showcase both the capabilities of the Ledger Secure `C` SDK and our development
environment and tools.

By cloning this application, you should find extensive examples on how to managed APDU communication, declare UI flows,
use cryptographic APIs, but also how to integrate into our build and test environment, and how to deploy your
application.

With very little changes, you should be able to quickly have an application of your own.

## CI

In the App Boilerplate you will find [a list of workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/tree/master/.github/workflows) to set up an efficient CI pipeline for your project.

Two of these workflows are a requirement to submit your device application:
- [Build_and_functional_tests](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml),
  which will build the app and run functional tests using the Ragger framework upon Speculos emulation
- [Guidelines_enforcer](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/guidelines_enforcer.yml),
  which calls a reusable workflow guidelines_enforcer developed by Ledger's internal developer team
