# Selector Setup

## contract.c

Let’s go to the first `EDIT THIS` comment in `app-plugin-boilerplate/src/contract.c`. In this file you can list all the selectors for each contract. In this example we have two selectors but we focus only on the first one.

The first selector (or methodID) to support is `SwapExactEthForToken` from Uniswap V2. 
You can find it using Etherscan, and you can also compose it using the ABI (Application Binary Interface).

By looking at [recent transactions on Uniswap](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d), we find a transaction with the "SwapExactEthForToken" method. Here is [an example](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x216bfa6fb8488901d168810cda1b716d1abcb002a87c3224180deaff00c950fc). Scroll down and click on "Click to see more", to read:

The header line shows `Method ID` to be `0x7ff36ab5`.  
This is going to be the 4 bytes of `SWAP_EXACT_ETH_FOR_TOKENS_SELECTOR`:
```c
static const uint32_t SWAP_EXACT_ETH_FOR_TOKENS_SELECTOR = 0x7ff36ab5;
```

Just a few lines below, the selectors are grouped in an array, in which there is `SWAP_EXACT_ETH_FOR_TOKENS_SELECTOR`. 

You can also change the name of `BOILERPLATE_SELECTORS` throughout the project code.

```c copy
// Array of all the different boilerplate selectors. 
// Make sure this follows the same order as the
// enum defined in `boilerplate_plugin.h`
const uint32_t BOILERPLATE_SELECTORS[NUM_SELECTORS] = {
    SWAP_EXACT_ETH_FOR_TOKENS_SELECTOR,
    BOILERPLATE_DUMMY_SELECTOR_2,
};
```
## boilerplate_plugin.h

Let's have a look at `app-plugin-boilerplate/src/boilerplate_plugin.h` mentioned in the code comments.

Start by checking the value of `NUM_SELECTORS`. Indeed, for the moment we only have two selectors.
```c copy
#define NUM_SELECTORS 2
```

Here `PLUGIN_NAME` is `Boilerplate`. Your plugin must be named appropriately here, and changed throughout the code

```c copy
#define PLUGIN_NAME "Boilerplate"
```

Now let's look for the selectors mentioned in the comments. Since it is an enum let's change it in our selector:
```c copy
typedef enum {
    SWAP_EXACT_ETH_FOR_TOKENS,
    BOILERPLATE_DUMMY_2,
} selector_t;
```

## handlers

Now we have to implement a handler for each case condition. They must all have a corresponding `handle_*.c` located in `src/`.
