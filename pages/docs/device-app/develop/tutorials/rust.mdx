# The `Rust` ðŸ¦€ boilerplate application

<Callout type="info">
Stax device support is not ready yet and should be available later.
</Callout>

The `Rust` Boilerplate application is taylored to showcase both the capabilities of the Ledger Device `Rust` [SDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-device-rust-sdk/tree/master) 
(also published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ledger_device_sdk)) and our development environment ([Docker containers](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder), 
[device emulator](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos), [test framework](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ragger)).

By cloning this application, you should find extensive examples on how to manage APDU communication, declare UI flows,
use cryptographic APIs, but also how to integrate into our build and test environment.

With very little changes, you should be able to quickly have an application of your own.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

In the Rust boilerplate application repository you will find [a list of workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate-rust/tree/main/.github/workflows) 
to set up an efficient CI pipeline for your project.

Two of them are <u>mandatory</u> to submit your device application for review:
- [Guidelines_enforcer](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate-rust/blob/main/.github/workflows/guidelines_enforcer.yml):
  this workflow calls a reusable workflow developed by Ledger's internal developer team,
- [Build and Run functional tests](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate-rust/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml): it builds 
the app and then runs functional tests. Functional tests can be run using the [Ragger](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ragger) framework upon [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos) 
emulation but you can also use your own framework upon Speculos.
