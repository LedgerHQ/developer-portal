# Frequently Asked Questions

| Question/Problem        |  Answer        |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| When trying to build a Ledger embedded app via the `make` command on some apps, this error could appear `fatal error: 'zxmacros.h' file not found` (or any other .h file).  | Run `git submodule update --init` on the repo’s root or `git clone https://github.com/application.git" --recurse-submodules`. |
| What is the maximum size of a message that can be sent in a single APDU?  | The length of the data part is 255 bytes and the whole message sent in a single APDU is 260 bytes with the blocks cla, ins, p1, p2 and one extra byte that encodes the length of the data that follows. |
| The Ledger team can not fork a repo which is already a fork on LedgerHQ *(e.g. ledger-panacea is a clone of ledger-cosmos but LedgerHQ has already a fork of ledger-cosmos)*. | This is a limitation of GitHub and the only solution for this is to break the link between the repository and the upstream one. This is done like in this [tutorial](https://ralphjsmit.com/unfork-github-repo).  |
| Can I freely choose the CLA in my embedded app as long as it is one byte or is there eanything I need to be aware of? | Apart from not using a few CLAs that are reserved for the SDK, OS, etc, developers are free to choose. For example, `0xB0` is for SDK.  |
| How can I load an app without Ledger Live on my ledger nano S or S+?  | Here are the links [to the documentation](./quickstart). |
| When I build the application, I have this error message: `No targets specified and no makefile found`. | You need to go down one level in the repo to the app subfolder and then run the `make` command. You must have launched your ledger-app-builder before. |
| I'm getting the error message `Ledger device: CLA_NOT_SUPPORTED`. | Many reasons could occur this error: the embedded app does not support the functionality you are implementing yet, you opened the wrong embedded app, or the CLA byte is not correctly set.|
| How do I verify that my product is genuine (in CLI)? | You can check it by connecting your hardware wallet and executing the following commands in this [documentation](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382029329-Check-hardware-integrity?support=true). |
| Could we submit an Embedded App for a developer release when the blockchain is still on testnet? | Yes, it's possible. |
| GitHub actions are suddenly failing because the code rely on `brew`, what should I do? | You have to remove `brew` from the codebase. `brew` has been removed from GitHub base ubuntu images. This [link](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/ubuntu20/20220922.2/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-Readme.md) is the description of the latest ubuntu image. It points to the [issue](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/6283) where `brew` has been removed. |
