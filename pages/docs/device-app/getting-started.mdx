## Your developer journey

### Engage with the Ledger developer community

Joining Discord is not required to code your embedded application, but it will be easier to meet with our team and discuss the specifics of your project. Join us on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) and introduce your project in the **#embedded-app** channel.

### Understand the process & meet the requirements

Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the [Process](../introduction/release-flow) and are able to meet the [Requirements](../submission/requirements) listed here.


### Begin Coding

Embedded applications are primarily developed in C using the Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System (BOLOS).

To develop an embedded application, ensure that you:
- Use Linux, Mac or Windows
- Use the [Ledger Framework](../quickstart/framework)
- Use either a physical device or the Speculos emulator (available in the [Ledger Framework](../quickstart/framework))


## Core concepts

### The BOLOS platform

BOLOS, the operating system powering all Ledger personal security devices, offers a lightweight and open-source framework. Developers can use this to build portable applications that run securely.

### Personal Security Devices

Ledger Personal Security Devices provide a secure and convenient way for users to store cryptographic secrets and sign transactions. Understanding their operation is crucial before starting the embedded application development process.
