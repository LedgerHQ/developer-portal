# Getting started

In this section of the Developer Portal, you will find the resources to build, test and submit C device apps, Rust device apps, <Glossary word="Ethereum"></Glossary> plugins and Cloned coins apps. 

## Things to know before starting

### Contact us 

We recommend you get in touch with us before starting your development process.
  - For general device applications, post a message in the #dev-support channel [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ledger).
  - For Ethereum plugins, fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2e4BAfuZJOUYKhqcxMvMGNY12ShZ-UG5Lu0Se8AIVdlu2lA/viewform) and contact us at discover@ledger.fr.

This will ensure you do not lose time and get on the right track.


### Security audit

Before publication, an application must go through a functional and <Glossary word="security audit"></Glossary>. This <Glossary word="security audit"></Glossary> is made by one of our parterns at your expense.

When your <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> is ready to go through the <Glossary word="security audit"></Glossary>, you can contact one of our partners:

- [Kudelski IoT]( https://www.kudelski-iot.com/services-and-systems/ledger-security-audit).
- [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/), contact them [here](mailto:qb_ledger@quarkslab.com).

They both follow Ledger specifications and will provide a full report with potential vulnerabilites.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ensure your <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> meets all necessary requirements and is fully tested before initiating a <Glossary word="security audit"></Glossary> with our partners
</Callout>

Important aspects of your agreement:
- Time: When the auditors will be able to start the review.
- Cost: The external audit will be entirely at your expense.
- Maintenance: You must include a clause for updates or sign a new contract for any major update. If you don't, your app will not be updated by Ledger and might be delisted from My Ledger apps store if it is breaking.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ledger is not a stakeholder in the contract between you and our partners.
</Callout>

## Need to hire a team to develop your device app?

You need an <Glossary word="device app"></Glossary> but don't have an application developer in your team?

The following companies have experience building Device Apps, feel free to contact them to talk about your project:
- [Blooo](https://blooo.io/en/ledger-wallet-integration/)
- [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems/)
- [Vacuumlabs](https://vacuumlabs.com/ledger )
- [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/)

## Tools and boilerplates

- To learn how to quickstart a project the Ledger VS code extension, read [this guide](./beginner/vscode-extension). The extension makes the environment set up, the app building, and the tests very easy.
- To start developing your project with the boilerplates, go in the How-to section in "Integration walkthroughs" and you will find [the C Boilerplate](./integration/how-to/c-boilerplate), [the Rust Boilerplate](./integration/how-to/rust-boilerplate), [the Ethereum plugin doc](./integration/how-to/plugin) and [the Cloned coins apps integration process](./integration/how-to/clone).
