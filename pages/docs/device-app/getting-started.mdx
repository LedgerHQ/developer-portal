# Getting started

In this section of the Developer Portal, you will find the resources to build, test and submit C and Rust apps, Ethereum plugins and Cloned coins apps, compatible with all Ledger devices (Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X, Stax and Flex).

## Things to know before starting

### Contact us 

We recommend you get in touch with us before starting your development process.
  - For general device applications, post a message in the #dev-support channel [on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ledger).
  - For Ethereum plugins, if you are not already in contact with one of our teams, fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2e4BAfuZJOUYKhqcxMvMGNY12ShZ-UG5Lu0Se8AIVdlu2lA/viewform) and contact us at discover@ledger.fr.

This will ensure you do not lose time and get on the right track.


### Security audit

Before publication, an application must go through a functional and security audit. This security audit is made by one of our parterns at your expense.

When your device app is ready to go through the security audit, you can contact one of our partners:

- [Kudelski IoT]( https://www.kudelski-iot.com/services-and-systems/ledger-security-audit).
- [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/), contact them [here](mailto:qb_ledger@quarkslab.com).

They both follow Ledger specifications and will provide a full report with potential vulnerabilites.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ensure your device app meets all necessary requirements and is fully tested before initiating a security audit with our partners
</Callout>

Important aspects of your agreement:
- Time: When the auditors will be able to start the review.
- Cost: The external audit will be entirely at your expense.
- Maintenance: You must include a clause for updates or sign a new contract for any major update. If you don't, your app will not be updated by Ledger and might be delisted from My Ledger apps store if it is breaking.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ledger is not a stakeholder in the contract between you and our partners.
</Callout>

## Need to hire a team to develop your device app?

You need an device app but don't have an application developer in your team?

The following companies have experience building Device Apps, feel free to contact them to talk about your project:
- [Blooo](https://blooo.io/en/ledger-wallet-integration/)
- [Hoodies](https://hoodies.team/)
- [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems/)
- [Vacuumlabs](https://vacuumlabs.com/ledger )
- [Zondax](https://zondax.ch/)

## Tools and boilerplates

- To learn how to quickstart a project with the Ledger VS code extension, read [this guide](./beginner/vscode-extension). The extension makes the environment set up, the app building, and the tests very easy.
- To start developing your project with the boilerplates, go in the How-to section in "Integration walkthroughs" and you will find [the C Boilerplate](./integration/how-to/c-boilerplate), [the Rust Boilerplate](./integration/how-to/rust-boilerplate), [the Ethereum plugin doc](./integration/how-to/plugin) and [the Cloned coins apps integration process](./integration/how-to/clone).
