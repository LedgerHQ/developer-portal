# What is a plugin?

Ledger devices works with embedded application coded in C or in Rust. Your EVM chain leverages the Ethereum app. But without a plugin, your users blind sign their transaction which is not secure enough.

For each EVM interacting with a smart contract, an app plugin is needed, and it will be the first step of your integration. 

Once the app plugin is ready, it will be downloadable from the "My Ledger" section of Ledger Live
Why do you need a device app plugin?
