# Connect a Ledger device with your companion app

Ledger devices need a software wallet to sign transactions on a blockchain. 

To implement the connectivity possibilities between your device plugin and your own project's marketplace, you will need to use Ledger packages or the DApp Connect Kit.

  As the DApp connect kit is meant to be working with a feature that is still experimental (the Ledger extension), we first recommend using LedgerJS Packages.
