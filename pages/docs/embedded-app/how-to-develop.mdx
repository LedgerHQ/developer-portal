# Clone Applications

## What is a clone?

A variant, or clone, embedded app is developed when all the logic for signing transactions can be contained in the parent coin Embedded Application.

As for any Embedded Application, you must follow our guidelines to comply with Ledger publication requirements.


## Which development process for your Ethereum clone?

Depending on your derivation path, the process will vary.

## What if my coin is a Bitcoin clone?

### New Bitcoin clone

For any other clone type, use the [main Embedded App process](../introduction/).

### Update an existing clone

If your Bitcoin clone was included in the Bitcoin Embedded App and you need to update it, please start a [new Embedded App process](../introduction/).
