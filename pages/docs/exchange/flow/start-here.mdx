## Glossary

- **Coin**: The native currency on the blockchain.
- **Token**: Not the native currency on the blockchain. If the blockchain is “Ethereum”, then only “id”: “ETH” has the type “coin”. All the other currencies on the Ethereum network have the type “token”. Here is an example of USDC on the ethereum network. 
	```json copy
	[
		{
			"id":"ETH",
			"type": "coin",
			"blockchain": "ethereum",
			"chainId": 1
		},
		{
			"id": "USDC",
			"type": "token",
			"blockchain": "ethereum",
			"chainId": 1,
			"contract": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48"
		}		
	]
	```
- **Account**: The Ledger wallet address on a cryptocurrency network. A user can have several accounts on the same blockchain (several ethereum addresses for instance)
- **Registration policy** Login and KYC
