# Provider's endpoints

In order to communicate with Ledger’s back-end, you have to give us the mapping of the endpoints we need.

As you can see on the diagram [What do we need?](../../howto), there are 5 main endpoints needed for the swap:
- To get the list of available currencies: [/currencies](#get-currencies).
- To get the list of tradable pairs: [/pairs](#get-pairs).
- To query a rate: [/quote](#post-quote).
- To create a signed swap binary payload [/swap](#post-swap).
- To query a swap status: [/status](#get-status).

You will find the details about each needed endpoint below.

[//]: # (Info needed to be exchange with the provider, but not out loud publicly)
[//]: # (**IP address checking** )
[//]: # (Additionally, we also need a way to know if a user will be able to perform a coin swap given his IP.)
[//]: # (Our back-end can adapt to how you decide to do this, but we recommend you use a dedicated endpoint. Our back-end will send the user’s IP address to that endpoint, without logging it. In response, your endpoint should tell us if the trade is accepted or rejected.)

### GET /currencies
- **Function**: Returns a list of supported currencies.
- **Input**: --
- **Output**: Array of supported currencies, with information required to uniquely identify coins/tokens.
- **Payload**:
```json copy
[
  {
    "id": "BTC",
    "type": "coin",
    "blockchain": "bitcoin",
    "chainId": 1
  },
  {
    "id": "USDC",
    "type": "token",
    "blockchain": "ethereum",
    "chainId": 1,
    "contract": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48"
  }
]
```

### GET /pairs
- **Function**: Returns a list of supported pairs. This endpoint is not required if all permutations returned by [/currencies](#get-currencies) are supported.
- **Input**: --
- **Output**: Array of supported swap pairs, with supported quote type (`fixed` / `float`).
- **Payload**:
```json copy
[
   {
      "from": "btc",
      "to": "bat",
      "tradeMethod":[
         "fixed",
         "float"
      ]
   },
   {
      "from": "bat",
      "to": "btc",
      "tradeMethod":[
         "fixed",
         "float"
      ]
   }
]
```

**Fixed quote**: The quote price is guaranteed until execution (or until end of quote validity period).
**Float quote**: The quote price is indicative only, real price is computed at execution time

### POST /quote
- **Function**: Returns a quote for a pair and amount.
- **Input**:
  - `from`: currency id in your system.
  - `to`: currency id in your system.
  - `amount`: amount requested by the user, without the gas fee.
- **Output**:
  - `quoteId`: quote unique identifier (optional, only required for fixed quotes)
  - `amount`: should be same as the input one (optional, only required for consistency check) (as an input coin floating amount)
  - `amountTo`: estimated output amount that will be sent to user (as an output coin floating amount)
  - `providerFees`: amount, expressed in currencyTo, that is paid to the provider.
  - `referralFees`: amount, expressed in currencyTo, that is paid to Ledger (as a referral fee).
  - `payoutNetworkFees`: estimated gas fees that will be used for the payout transaction (as an output coin floating amount)
  - `tradeMethod`: `fixed` or `float` (optional, only required for consistency check)
  - `expiry`: quote expiration timestamp (optional, only required for fixed quotes)
  - `minAmountFrom`: minimum valid `amount` for this pair (optional, only required if amount is too low)
  - `maxAmountFrom`: maximum valid `amount` for this pair (optional, only required if amount is too large)

- **Payload**:
  - Success
```json copy
{
   "quoteId": "CC14E626-CF1B-4EDA-AF5E-766FFD5A3457",
   "amount": "1",
   "amountTo": "270.864632",
   "providerFees": "0.0001",
   "referralFees": "0.0001",
   "payoutNetworkFees": "0.0002",
   "tradeMethod": "float",
   "expiry": "2022-04-04T09:10:51+0000" // ISO-8601 date format
}
```

All fees are expressed in output currency. For example, during a ETH to USDT on ethereum swap, the fees are expressed in USDT on ethereum.

Some requirements about the **/quote** endpoint:
- The quote must work without user auth. It can require a Ledger auth.
- The quote must be valid long enough (at least a few minutes).

### POST /swap
- **Function**: Generates a secure binary payload for the nano in order to authorize the transaction. The provider should validate consistency between `quoteId` and other inputs (addresses, amounts and currencies).
- **Input**:
  - `quoteId`: previously generated quote id
  - `refundAddress`: user's refund address. This address is generaly the fromAddress.
  - `refundAddressExtraId`: tag or memo (optional).
  - `payoutAddress`: user's payout transaction address.
  - `payoutAddressExtraId`: tag or memo (optional).
  - `currencyFrom`: from currency id, using your identifiers (for checking purpose on your side only) (optional).
  - `currencyTo`: to currency id, using you identifiers (for checking purpose on your side only) (optional).
  - `payloadCurrencyFrom`: from currency id, using ledger's referencial. This value has to be used for `currency_from` field in the protobuf payload.
  - `payloadCurrencyTo`: to currency id, using ledger's referencial. This value has to used for `currency_to` field in the protobuf payload.
  - `amountToProvider`: amount of `currencyFrom` that the provider expects to receive from client.
  - `amountToWallet`: amount of `currencyTo` that the provider agrees to send to the client in exchange from (optional for a *float* trade).
  - `nonce`: value to use for `device_transaction_id` field in the protobuf payload.
- **Output**:
  - `swapId`: provider's id of the ongoing swap transaction. This will be used by Ledger's backend to retrieve the status of user swap transaction.
  - `payinAddress`: provider's address.
  - `createdAt`: date of creation of the swap payload in ISO-8601 format.
  - `providerFees`: amount, expressed in currencyTo, that is paid to the provider.
  - `referralFees`: amount, expressed in currencyTo, that is paid to Ledger (as a referral fee).
  - `payoutNetworkFees`: estimated gas fees that will be used for the payout transaction (as an output coin floating amount).
  - `providerSig`:
    - `payload`: protobuf payload (in a binary format)
    - `signature`: payload signed in a JWS format
- **Payload**:
  - Success 
  Refer to payload in the [JWS signature](#jws-signature) section below.

Here is a little diagram to explain how the `payload` and the `signature` are generated:

<Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Payload and Payload Signature generation diagram"
      src="/payload-signature-generation.png"
    />
</Zoom>


- `payload`: the trade parameters are assembled in a [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) message. Then using the protobuf tools we do a [binary encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) of the protobuf (Byte Array). Finally, with [base64 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `payload` field.
- `signature`: From the binary encoding of the previous [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (Byte Array), we sign it with [ES256](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ES256) and the provider's private key to get a Signature Byte Array. Finally, with [base64 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `signature`.


#### Input field: nonce

A nonce field will be passed as a parameter of the **/swap** endpoint.  
It is a 32 bytes nonce which is generated by the hardware wallet to avoid replay attacks.  
It will be base 64 URL encoded before being sent to the **/swap** endpoint.

#### Protobuf message (payload)

Your Protobuf message should have the following structure:

```go copy
syntax = "proto3";
package ledger_swap;

message NewTransactionResponse {
    string    payin_address = 1;
    string    payin_extra_id = 2;
    string    refund_address = 3;
    string    refund_extra_id = 4;
    string    payout_address = 5;
    string    payout_extra_id = 6;
    string    currency_from = 7;
    string    currency_to = 8;
    bytes     amount_to_provider = 9;
    bytes     amount_to_wallet = 10;
    string    device_transaction_id = 11; // nonce
}
```

Explanation of each fields:
- `payin_address`: provider address to receive payment
- `payin_extra_id`: eventual memo for the payment (stellar payment, for instance)
- `refund_address`: client address to receive back the payment funds in case the provider is not able to execute the swap for some unpredictable reasons
- `refund_extra_id`: eventual memo for the payment (stellar payment, for instance)
- `payout_address`: client address to receive the money resulting from a successful swap
- `payout_extra_id`: eventual memo for the payment (stellar payment, for instance)
- `currency_from`: must be set to value of `payloadCurrencyFrom` from the [/swap API request](#post-swap)
- `currency_to`: must be set to value of `payloadCurrencyTo` from the [/swap API request](#post-swap)
- `amount_to_provider`: amount of `currency_from` that the provider expects to receive from client
- `amount_to_wallet`: amount of `currency_to` that the provider agrees to send to the client in exchange from `amount_to_provider`. This amount must also include the network fees that the provider will pay to send the crypto to the user.
- `device_transaction_id`: swap transaction nonce provided by client at initialization (must be set to value of `nonce` from the API request)

Amounts must be in the lowest unit of the coin, encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian.

- 1 **BTC** would be `0x5F5E100` (100000000 in hexadecimal). The smallest unit is a **satoshi** which is `10^-8` **BTC**.
So multiply 1 **BTC** by `10^8` → `0x5F5E100`. 
And `0x5F5E100` encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian is `[0x00, ... 0x00, 0x05, 0xF5, 0xE1, 0x00]`.
- 2 **ETH** would be `0x1BC16D674EC80000` (or 2000000000000000000). The smallest unit is a **wei** which is `10^-18` **ETH**.
So multiply 2 **ETH** by `10^18` → `0x1BC16D674EC80000`.
And `0x1BC16D674EC80000` encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian is `[0x00, ... 0x00, 0x1B, 0xC1, 0x6D, 0x67, 0x4E, 0xC8, 0x00, 0x00]`.

#### Output field: providerSig

The real return value of the **/swap** endpoint is the `providerSig` field with the JSON Web Signature (JWS) in compact form within:
- `providerSig.payload` - base 64 URL of the binary serialized protobuf message.NewTransactionResponse.
- `providerSig.signature` - base 64 URL of the ES256 signature of providerSig.payload. More details in the [JWS signature](#jws-signature) and [Protobuf message (payload)](#protobuf-message-payload) sections.

#### Signature usage
- Payload and Signature
From the provider to Ledger Live. The payload is a protobuf message containing the trade data. It is generated by the provider and sent to Ledger Live.
```go copy
payload = {
  payin_address,      // address (of provider)
  refund_address,     // address (of customer)
  payout_address,     // address (of customer)
  currency_from,      // currency name (to provider)
  currency_to,
  amount_to_provider, // amount (to provider)
  amount_to_wallet,   // amount (to customer)
  device_transaction_id,
  …
}
R, S = Sign(payload, priv_key)
```

- Validate 
Exchange app checks and validates payload (signature and content).
```go copy
// Compare nonce in payload
Verify((R, S), payload, pub_key)
```

- Display  
Exchange app request approval to user by displaying swap summary on screen. 
```c copy
Validate?
Send currency_from amount_to_provider
Receive currency_to amount_to_wallet
```

#### JWS-Signature
The output field is `providerSig` is base on the [flattened JWS JSON](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-7.2.2), without the optional `protected` and `header` parameter.

The algorithm supported by Ledger are [ES256](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3.4) with secp256k1 or secp256r1 curve. There is no need to specify them into the `header`,
as we will store your public key with this information in our system.

As specified in the JWA spec, the signature is a concatenation of the (R, S) pair in a 64 octets array, and not the ASN1 format.

### GET /status
- **Function**: Returns the status of an executed swap transaction.
- **Input**: `swapId`.
- **Output**:
  - `status`:
    - `FINISHED`: Trade has been completed successfully (user has received payout transaction).
    - `EXPIRED`: Payin transaction was not received in time, trade is cancelled. User will be refunded if payin transaction is received afterwards.
    - `ON_HOLD`: Trade has been put on hold (eg: for KYC reasons). User must contact support.
    - `PENDING`: Trade is in progress (provider is waiting to receive payin transaction, or user is waiting to receive payout transaction)
    - `REFUNDED`: Trade has been cancelled, refund transaction has been successfully received by user.
    - `UNKNOWN`: Trade is in unknown state. User must contact support.
  - `amount`: as soon as this information is known, this should contain the final amount transferred to the user in output currency
  - `payinTransactionId`: as soon as this information is known, this should contain the payin transaction hash
  - `payoutTransactionId`: as soon as this information is known, this should contain the payout transaction hash
  - `providerFees`: fees amount that has been paid to the provider.
  - `referralFees`: fees amount that has been paid to Ledger (as a referral fee).
  - `payoutNetworkFees`: gas fees that has been be used for the payout transaction (as an output coin floating amount).
- **Payload**:
  - Success
```json copy
{
  "status":"FINISHED",
  "amount": 1.337,
  "payinTransactionId": "0xfffffffffffff",
  "payoutTransactionId": "0xfffffffffffff",
  "providerFees": "0.0001",
  "referralFees": "0.0001",
  "payoutNetworkFees": "0.0002"
}
```
