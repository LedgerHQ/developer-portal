# Backend

<BackendIntro />

## Endpoints needed for Swap

In order to communicate with Ledger’s backend, you must provide standardised APIs for Ledger's SWAP aggregator services to call.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🔗">
You will find all the information regarding the SWAP endpoints here: https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/, as well as additional details on some endpoints below.
</Callout>

There are 5 main endpoints needed for the swap:

- To get the list of available currencies: [/currencies](https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/#operation/getCurrencies).
- To get the list of tradable pairs: [/pairs](https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/#operation/getPairs).
- To query a rate: [/quote](https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/#operation/postQuote).
- To create a signed swap binary payload [/swap](https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/#operation/postSwap).
- To query a swap status: [/status](https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/#operation/getStatus).

<details>
  <summary>Additional Details: GET /pairs</summary>

    This endpoint is not required if all permutations returned by [/currencies](https://exchange-integration-swap.redoc.ly/#operation/getCurrencies) are supported.

    **Fixed quote**: The quote price is guaranteed until execution (or until end of quote validity period).

    **Float quote**: The quote price is indicative only, real price is computed at execution time.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Additional Details: POST /quote</summary>

    All fees are expressed in output currency. For example, during a ETH to USDT on ethereum swap, the fees are expressed in USDT on ethereum.

    Some requirements about the **/quote** endpoint:
    - The quote must work without user auth. It can require a Ledger auth.
    - The quote must be valid long enough (at least a few minutes).

    Your Protobuf message should have the following structure:

    ```go copy
    syntax = "proto3";
    package ledger_swap;

    message NewTransactionResponse {
        string    payin_address = 1;
        string    payin_extra_id = 2;
        string    refund_address = 3;
        string    refund_extra_id = 4;
        string    payout_address = 5;
        string    payout_extra_id = 6;
        string    currency_from = 7;
        string    currency_to = 8;
        bytes     amount_to_provider = 9;
        bytes     amount_to_wallet = 10;
        string    device_transaction_id = 11; // Legacy nonce, no need to give a value
        bytes     device_transaction_id_ng = 12; // nonce
    }
    ```

    Explanation of each fields:
    - `payin_address`: provider address to receive payment
    - `payin_extra_id`: eventual memo for the payment (stellar payment, for instance)
    - `refund_address`: client address to receive back the payment funds in case the provider is not able to execute the swap for some unpredictable reasons
    - `refund_extra_id`: eventual memo for the payment (stellar payment, for instance)
    - `payout_address`: client address to receive the money resulting from a successful swap
    - `payout_extra_id`: eventual memo for the payment (stellar payment, for instance)
    - `currency_from`: must be set to value of `payloadCurrencyFrom` from the [/swap API request](#post-swap)
    - `currency_to`: must be set to value of `payloadCurrencyTo` from the [/swap API request](#post-swap)
    - `amount_to_provider`: amount of `currency_from` that the provider expects to receive from client
    - `amount_to_wallet`: amount of `currency_to` that the provider agrees to send to the client in exchange from `amount_to_provider`. This amount must also include the network fees that the provider will pay to send the crypto to the user.
    - `device_transaction_id`: swap transaction nonce provided by client at initialization (must be set to value of `nonce` from the API request) - this is a legacy property, only used by historical parter
    - `device_transaction_id_ng`: swap transaction nonce provided by client at initialization (must be set to value of `nonce` from the API request)

    Amounts must be in the lowest unit of the coin, encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian.

    - 1 **BTC** would be `0x5F5E100` (100000000 in hexadecimal). The smallest unit is a **satoshi** which is `10^-8` **BTC**.
    So multiply 1 **BTC** by `10^8` → `0x5F5E100`. 
    And `0x5F5E100` encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian is `[0x00, ... 0x00, 0x05, 0xF5, 0xE1, 0x00]`.
    - 2 **ETH** would be `0x1BC16D674EC80000` (or 2000000000000000000). The smallest unit is a **wei** which is `10^-18` **ETH**.
    So multiply 2 **ETH** by `10^18` → `0x1BC16D674EC80000`.
    And `0x1BC16D674EC80000` encoded into a 16 bytes array in big endian is `[0x00, ... 0x00, 0x1B, 0xC1, 0x6D, 0x67, 0x4E, 0xC8, 0x00, 0x00]`.

    You also should ensure the following fields length limitations :
    ```
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.payin_address max_size:63;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.payin_extra_id max_size:81;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.refund_address max_size:63;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.refund_extra_id max_size:20;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.payout_address max_size:63;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.payout_extra_id max_size:20;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.currency_from max_size:10;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.currency_to max_size:10;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.amount_to_provider max_size:16;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.amount_to_wallet max_size:16;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.device_transaction_id max_size:11;
    ledger_swap.NewTransactionResponse.device_transaction_id_ng max_size:32;
    ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Additional Details: GET /status</summary>
    Explanation of the different output `status`:
        - `FINISHED`: Trade has been completed successfully (user has received payout transaction).
        - `EXPIRED`: Payin transaction was not received in time, trade is cancelled. User will be refunded if payin transaction is received afterwards.
        - `ON_HOLD`: Trade has been put on hold (eg: for KYC reasons). User must contact support.
        - `PENDING`: Trade is in progress (provider is waiting to receive payin transaction, or user is waiting to receive payout transaction)
        - `REFUNDED`: Trade has been cancelled, refund transaction has been successfully received by user.
        - `UNKNOWN`: Trade is in unknown state. User must contact support.  

</details>

[//]: # (Info needed to be exchange with the provider, but not out loud publicly)
[//]: # (**IP address checking** )
[//]: # (Additionally, we also need a way to know if a user will be able to perform a coin swap given his IP.)
[//]: # (Our back-end can adapt to how you decide to do this, but we recommend you use a dedicated endpoint. Our back-end will send the user’s IP address to that endpoint, without logging it. In response, your endpoint should tell us if the trade is accepted or rejected.)

## Payload & Signature

Here is a little diagram to explain how the `payload` and the `signature` are generated:

<Zoom>
    <img
      alt="Payload and Payload Signature generation diagram"
      src="/exchange/payload-signature-generation-swap.png"
    />
</Zoom>

- `payload`: the trade parameters are assembled in a [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) message. Then using the protobuf tools we do a [binary encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) of the protobuf (Byte Array). Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `payload` field.
- `signature`: From the binary encoding of the previous [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (Byte Array), we sign it with [ES256](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ES256) and the provider's private key to get a Signature Byte Array. Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `signature` field ([more details](#jws-signature)).

### Signature usage

- Payload and Signature  
From the provider to Ledger Live. The payload is a protobuf message containing the trade data. It is generated by the provider and sent to Ledger Live.

```go copy
type Payload struct {
  payin_address,      // address (of provider)
  refund_address,     // address (of customer)
  payout_address,     // address (of customer)
  currency_from,      // currency name (to provider)
  currency_to,
  amount_to_provider, // amount (to provider)
  amount_to_wallet,   // amount (to customer)
  device_transaction_id,
  device_transaction_id_ng,
  …
}
R, S := Sign(payload, privKey)
```

- Validate  
Exchange app checks and validates the payload (signature and content).

```go copy
// Compare nonce in payload
Verify((R, S), payload, pubKey)
```

- Display  
Exchange app requests approval to the user by displaying the operation summary on screen.

```c copy
Validate?
Send currency_from amount_to_provider
Receive currency_to amount_to_wallet
```
