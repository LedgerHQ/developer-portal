| --------------- | -------------- | 
| My token is not an ERC20, BEP20, Polygon, ASA, TRC10 or TRC20 token   | We do not support the addition of tokens for the moment. If we do in the future, it will be added in the documentation. | 
| I want to add a coin, not a token.  | In that case you should go to the [Blockchain support section](../../blockchain). If you are not a developer and the coin you are looking for is not supported, ask the Blockchain project team to do the integration. | 
| "Please add this token." | If you don't follow the procedure correctly, your token won't be added to Ledger Live. |
