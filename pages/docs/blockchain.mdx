## General Ledger Live Overview

If you already have a public [Ledger device application](./device-app/) and are looking for a way to get your blockchain supported on Ledger Live, then congratulations, you are in the right place. To confirm if your embedded application is already supported, please check if your currency is visible on [this page](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/).

The Ledger Live application acts as a user-friendly platform for managing the digital assets as well as the application installed on the Ledger device.

Having your blockchain supported on Ledger Live will allow the community of users to easily interact with your protocol.

Ledger Live offers a standardized UI combined with a high quality of service. It also offers several features that are not available through other wallets.

**These features include:**
- Sending & receiving the Blockchain native currency and its tokens
- Displaying account balances and operation history
- Staking cryptocurrency (where applicable) to earn rewards

The Ledger Live application is available for Windows, Mac and Linux in its desktop version and on Android & iOS for mobile.

To be officially released by Ledger, your protocol must be included on all five platforms Ledger Live (Windows / MacOS / Linux / Android / iOS).


## Open source, but not Open bar

The Ledger Live code is Open source under MIT license. As such, you are free to copy/fork and modify it at will.

In some rare cases, you may want to go it alone, and do your own Solo Integration, where there is virtually no interaction with Ledger, nor code review, nor supported communication by Ledger to your blockchain community. You are free to use this documentation in that way.

In most cases however, you will want to have your blockchain officially supported in Ledger Live for your community, with an updated release of Ledger Live Desktop and Mobile. In this case it is a Participant Integration, because this involves various Ledger teams: Security, Product, Engineering and QA, we will have discussions with you to enter into an Agreement Framework in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities between us.
