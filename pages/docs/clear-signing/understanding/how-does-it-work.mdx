# How does Clear Signing work?

Clear Signing functions through a collaborative ecosystem approach that involves dApp developers, wallet providers, and the registry system.

## The Clear Signing process

1. **Metadata Creation**: Developers create Json files describing smart contract functions
2. **Submit the file to the registry**: The Json is submitted to the Clear Signing Registry through a GitHub pull request
3. **Validation**: Ledger validates the Json file
4. **Wallet Integration**: Wallets fetch the metadata when users need to sign transactions
5. **Enhanced Display**: Instead of showing raw transaction data, wallets present clear, understandable information about what the user is signing

## Key components

### A. Metadata Files

Json files that follow the ERC-7730 standard and contain:

- Contract information (name, address, chain ID)
- Method definitions with readable parameter descriptions
- Display instructions for formatting parameters

### B. Registry System

The [Clear Signing Registry](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry) is a GitHub repository that:

- Hosts metadata files for smart contracts and EIP-712 messages
- Provides a submission and review process
- Makes metadata accessible to all wallet implementations

### C. Generic Parser

The Generic Parser is a system that:

- Interprets JSON metadata files at runtime
- Decodes transaction data using contract ABIs
- Formats the data according to display instructions

### D. Wallet Integration

Wallet providers integrate Clear Signing through the Device Management Kit (DMK) and the Device Signer Kit (DSK).
