# How does Clear Signing work?

Clear Signing functions through a collaborative ecosystem approach that involves dApp developers, wallet providers, and the registry system.

## The Clear Signing process

1. **Metadata Creation**: Developers create JSON files describing smart contract functions
2. **Submit the file to the registry**: Metadata is submitted to the Clear Signing Registry through a GitHub pull request
3. **Validation**: Wallets validate metadata against constraints before displaying
4. **Wallet Integration**: Wallets fetch the metadata when users need to sign transactions
5. **Enhanced Display**: Instead of showing raw transaction data, wallets present clear, understandable information about what the user is signing

## Key components

### 1. Metadata Files

JSON files that follow the ERC-7730 standard and contain:

- Contract information (name, address, chain ID)
- Method definitions with readable parameter descriptions
- Display instructions for formatting parameters

### 2. Registry System

The [Clear Signing Registry](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry) is a GitHub repository that:

- Hosts metadata files for smart contracts and EIP-712 messages
- Provides a submission and review process
- Makes metadata accessible to all wallet implementations

### 3. Generic Parser

The Generic Parser (currently in development) is a system that:

- Interprets JSON metadata files at runtime
- Decodes transaction data using contract ABIs
- Formats the data according to display instructions

### 4. Wallet Integration

Wallet providers integrate Clear Signing through:

- The Device Management Kit (DMK) for desktop applications
- The Device Signer Kit (DSK) for mobile and web wallets
- Legacy integration through updated LedgerJS libraries
