# Implementing clear Signing for wallets

## New implementation

To incorporate Clear Signing into your wallet, use the [Device Managament Kit](../device-interaction/getting-started) and the [Device Signer Kit (LDMK)](../device-interaction/integration/how_to/how_to_use_a_signer). 
This kit supersedes the LedgerJS transport libraries, enabling straightforward device interaction coding within your wallet and offering built-in Clear Signing support.

## Updating an existing LedgerJS implementation

If your application currently uses the LedgerJS Ethereum transport library, we recommend upgrading to the LDMK for improved functionality. 

However, if you're not prepared to transition to the LDMK, ensure you are using [the latest LedgerJS version](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/b2163a6eaafd46390d4a14bad8e62fcc10454c05/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-app-eth) to maintain compatibility and security.
