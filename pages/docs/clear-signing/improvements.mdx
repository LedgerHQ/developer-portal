# The future of Clear Signing

## What's next for Clear Siging with Ledger

Ledger constantly evolves its Clear Signing capabilities to enhance user experience and ecosystem integration. Here’s a glimpse of upcoming developments.  

### Interactive Json builder and Clear Signing visualizer 

Ledger plans to release an open-source tool that enables developers to craft and modify JSON descriptions easily. This tool will also serve as a visual display of how information appears on Ledger devices, simplifying the creation and validation process of metadata files.  

### Generic Parser

The Ethereum Generic Parser is being developed as a crucial tool for ensuring seamless integration of Clear Signing.  
Its primary function is to interpret the JSON files, enabling the information in smart contracts to be displayed accurately and effectively on Ledger devices.  

### Extension of this process to other protocols

Ledger is working on extending Clear Signing support to other protocols (including Solana, Tron, and others).  
This expansion broadens Clear Signing’s applicability in the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring versatile and consistent experiences across different blockchains.  

### Decentralization of the peer review process

Ledger is exploring ways to decentralize the peer review process for metadata submissions, empowering the community to collaborate in validating and improving the Clear Signing registry.  

## Expending the standard to the Web3 Ecosystem

Ledger is committed to fostering community contributions to the Clear Signing registry and encourages all wallet manufacturers and developers to adopt this standard. By expanding its use, we aim to enhance the security of the entire ecosystem and simplify smart contract interaction for users worldwide.  

Ledger envisions the JSON standard becoming integral to the Web3 ecosystem, fostering a secure and user-friendly environment for all participants.  
Your involvement is key to realizing this vision, and we invite you to join us in building a secure, decentralized future.
