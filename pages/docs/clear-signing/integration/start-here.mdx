<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Some complex smart contracts or specialized use cases may require a dedicated plugin (a device app) instead of just submitting metadata files to the registry. This is typically necessary for contracts with unusual execution patterns, non-standard data structures, or custom security requirements. If your implementation doesn't work properly with the metadata approach, please contact Ledger to discuss the possibility of developing a dedicated plugin.
