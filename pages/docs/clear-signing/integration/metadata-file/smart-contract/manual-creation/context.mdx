# 1. Context section 

First you need to write the `“context”` section. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The goal of the `“context”` section is to provide binding context information for this file. It indicates whether the ERC-7730 file is valid for this data, according to 2 main constraints: the deployment field and the ABI specification.
</Callout>

In this example, the context section indicates that the ERC-7730 file should only be applied to the USDT smart contract whose deployment addresses are provided and only if they match the reference ABI.

```json
    "context": {
        "$id": "Tether USD",
        "contract" : {
            "abi": "https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=contract&action=getabi&address=0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",
            "deployments": [ 
                {
                    "chainId": 1,
                    "address": "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"
                },
                {
                    "chainId": 137,
                    "address": "0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F"
                },
                {
                    "chainId": 42161,
                    "address": "0xFd086bC7CD5C481DCC9C85ebE478A1C0b69FCbb9"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
```

  <summary>For EIP-712 messages</summary>

    Same mechanic, but with some minor differences: 
    -  We need to specify that this file is for EIP-712 messages first.
    - The `deployments` field will list all the verifying contracts that will check this EIP-712
    - Instead of the ABI specification, we will use `schemas` and `domain` to describe the structure of our EIP-712 message(s) and match names with versions. 

    Here is the example of the `context` section from [1inch](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry/1inch/eip712-1inch-limit-order.json). We will dig into the details below. 


    ```json
    "context": {
        "eip712": {
        "deployments": [
            { "chainId": 1, "address": "0x119c71d3bbac22029622cbaec24854d3d32d2828" },
            { "chainId": 10, "address": "0x11431a89893025d2a48dca4eddc396f8c8117187" },
            { "chainId": 56, "address": "0x1e38eff998df9d3669e32f4ff400031385bf6362" },
            { "chainId": 137, "address": "0x94bc2a1c732bcad7343b25af48385fe76e08734f" },
            { "chainId": 42161, "address": "0x7f069df72b7a39bce9806e3afaf579e54d8cf2b9" }
        ],
        "domain": { "name": "Permit2" },
        "schemas": [
            {
            "primaryType": "OrderStructure",
            "types": {
                "EIP712Domain": [
                { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
                { "name": "version", "type": "string" },
                { "name": "chainId", "type": "uint256" },
                { "name": "verifyingContract", "type": "address" }
                ],
                "OrderStructure": [
                { "name": "salt", "type": "uint256" },
                { "name": "maker", "type": "address" },
                { "name": "receiver", "type": "address" },
                { "name": "makerAsset", "type": "address" },
                { "name": "takerAsset", "type": "address" },
                { "name": "makingAmount", "type": "uint256" },
                { "name": "takingAmount", "type": "uint256" },
                { "name": "makerTraits", "type": "uint256" }
                ]
            }
            },
    ```

## a. ABI specification 

You have two ways of specifying the ABI: 
- You can use an url pointing at the ABI (like we did in this example)
- You can copy/paste the entire ABI ([etherscan solidity compiler](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)). You don’t necessarily need to paste the entire ABI, you can keep only the functions that you want to clear sign, and remove for instance the events and read functions.
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The ABI is used to define unique path references to fields being formatted in the `display.formats` section, so the ABI is mandatory for all contracts clear-signed.
</Callout>

<details>
  <summary>For EIP-712 messages</summary>

    Like we said, instead of the ABI, we will use `schemas` and `domain` to describe the structure of our EIP-712 message(s) and match names with versions. 

    The` domain` constraint is a json object with simple key-value pairs, describing a set of values that the EIP-712 Domain of the message MUST match.

    An EIP-712 `domain` is a free-form list of keys, but those are very common to include:
    - `name`: the name of the message verifier
    - `version`: the version of the message
    - `chainID`: an [EIP-155](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/eip-155.md) identifier of the chain the message is bound to
    - `verifyingContract`: the address the message is bound to.

    Note that `chainId` and `verifyingContract` can also be bound to their values thanks to the `eip712.deployments` constraint, in a more flexible way (supporting multiple deployment values).

</details>

## b. Deployment field

Under the `"deployments"` field, you need to specify where exactly the clear signing file will be applied, by adding the chain id and deployment addresses: 
- `chainId`: an EIP-155 identifier of the chain where the described contract is deployed (you can find it here: [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/))
- `address`: the address of the deployed contract on the specified` chainId` chain.

<details>
    <summary>For EIP-712 messages</summary>

    The `deployments` field will list all the smart contract deployments that will check this EIP-712

    A deployment option is an object with:
    - `chainId`: an EIP-155 identifier of the chain the described contract is deployed on.
    - `address`: the address of the deployed contract on specified `chainId` chain.
