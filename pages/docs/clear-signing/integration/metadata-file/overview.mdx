# Implementation Overview

By following this guide, you'll create and submit metadata files that allow users to see clear, human-readable information when signing transactions or messages from your dApp on a Ledger device.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Currently, Clear Signing implementation is supported for EVM chains only. Support for other protocols is in development.

## Task 1: Determine Which Metadata Files You Need

| Your Use Case | Required Metadata | Tools Available |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| <b>Smart Contract Transactions</b> <br/> Users interact with your smart contract functions | [Smart Contract metadata](./smart-contract/json-builder) | <ul><li>✅ ERC-7730 JSON Builder</li><li>✅ Manual creation</li></ul>|
| <b>EIP-712 Structured Data</b> <br/> Users sign structured messages from your dApp | [EIP-712 metadata](./EIP712-message) | <ul><li>❌ JSON Builder not supported</li><li>✅ Manual creation with template</li></ul>|
| <b>Both Transaction Types</b> <br/> Users interact with contracts and sign structured data | Both metadata types in separate files | Mixed approach needed |

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Regardless of which type of metadata file you create, the submission process to the registry is the same. All metadata files are submitted to the same repository.
</Callout>

## Task 2: Create Your Metadata Files

### Option A: Create Smart Contract Metadata

    - Recommended: Use the ERC-7730 [JSON Builder](https://get-clear-signed.ledger.com/). Its [Guide](./smart-contract/json-builder) is here
    - Alternative: Create the file manually following the [Smart Contract Metadata guidelines](./smart-contract/manual-creation)

### Option B: Create EIP-712 Metadata

Create your metadata file manually [using the EIP-712 Standard](./EIP712-message)

### Option C: Create Both Types (if needed)

Follow both Option A and Option B to create separate metadata files for each purpose.

## Task 3: Test the validity of the file

Use the JSON schema validator to check that your metadata file complies with the ERC-7730 standard before submission.

## Task 4: Submit to the Registry

Submit your validated metadata file to the [Clear Signing Registry](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry) for inclusion in the ecosystem.
