# Submit the file to the registry

To make your Clear Signing metadata available to all compatible wallets, you need to submit it to the [Clear Signing Registry](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry). This section walks through the submission process step by step.

## Submision steps

### Step 1: Create your metadata file

Before submission, create your metadata file following the ERC-7730 standard. You can use the JSON Builder or create it manually.

### Step 2: Fork the registry repository

1. Go to the [Clear Signing Registry](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry) on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine

### Step 3: Add your metadata file

1. Add your file to the `registry/{dapp-name}/` directory, where `{dapp-name}` is the name of your dApp or project (e.g., `registry/aave/` for Aave)
Name your file according to the contract purpose or functionality: `{name}.json` (e.g., `calldata-lpv2.json` for Aave's Lending Pool v2)

### Step 4: Create a Pull request

1. Commit your changes to your forked repository
2. Push the changes to GitHub
3. Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click "Contribute" to create a pull request
4. Fill in the pull request template with information about your submission

### Step 5 : Review process

1. Automated checks will run to validate your metadata file
2. Reviewers will examine your submission and may request changes
3. Once approved, your metadata will be merged into the registry

## Curation process

1. Community Curation: Initial review in the public repository to verify format and basic correctness
2. Wallet-Specific Curation: Additional verification by wallet providers before including in their trusted repository
