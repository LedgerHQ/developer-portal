## Introduction

For Smart Contracts, clear signing is done via a single JSON parsing file.

There are 2 ways to create the JSON file:  
### Automatically  
Using the codeless ERC7730 JSON builder  
You can display the screens as you go along to see how the clear signing will like on a device. In this page, we take Aave as an example.  
Follow the [JSON Builder](./json-builder) process here to build and submit your file.   

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The tool is still in Alpha mode, if you encounter any error, please provide feedback using [this form](https://tally.so/r/mObbWM).
</Callout>

### Manually
Instead of using the Builder, you can manually write the JSON:  
Refer to example files available in the [registry directory](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry).  
Use the [JSON schema](https://eips.ethereum.org/assets/eip-7730/erc7730-v1.schema.json) and [specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7730).  
Follow the [JSON Structure](./smart-contract) process here to build and submit your file.
