# dApps Clear Signing implementation with ERC-7730

## Overview 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Currently, this implementation is supported for EVM chains only. Stay tuned for updates on other protocols!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Some special cases may require the development of an [Ethereum plugin](../device-app/getting-started). The Ledger team will guide you through this process if required.
</Callout>

This guide will walk you through the process of implementing clear signing for ERC-7730 on EVM chains. This implementation uses a registry of smart contract metadata files.

After your changes are merged, the Ledger **generic parser** will integrate them, making them available on Ledger devices such as Ledger Flex and Ledger Stax. The "generic parser" serves as the middle-layer deployed on the Ledger infrastructure to read and parse your JSON files.

This preview example shows how clear signing operations will be displayed:

    />
  </figure>
</div>

## How to Add Your Metadata to the Registry


### Step 1: Create a Metadata File and preview on device 

The Metadata file contains the description of your smart contract data according to the ERC-7730 standard.

- Generate this file with the [ERC7730 JSON builder](./json-builder). The JSON builder also provide screenshots of your clear signing operation on device.

To manually write the JSON:
- Refer to example files available in the [registry directory](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry).
- Follow the JSON schema and specification in the [specs/erc7730-v1.schema.json](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/erc7730-v1.schema.json) and [specs/erc-7730.md](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/erc-7730.md).


### Step 2: Fork the Official Registry and open a Pull Request

The official registry is hosted on GitHub: [ERC-7730 Registry](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry).

- Review the [PR requirements](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/README.md) detailed in the README.
- Automated checks will run to provide feedback on your files.
- Repo approvers will review your submission and provide comments to assist the process.
- Once approved, your metadata will be merged into the registry.

**Success!** You have added your metadata to the registry 🎉

## Generic Parser Status

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Generic Parser Not Yet Ready:** Please be aware that the Ledger generic parser is currently undergoing development and is not yet operational. This means that even after your metadata is merged, it won't immediately be available on Ledger devices. We appreciate your patience and will notify you once the parser is fully functional and capable of integrating metadata with Ledger devices.
