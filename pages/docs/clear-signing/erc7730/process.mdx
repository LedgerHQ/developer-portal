## Introduction

For Smart Contracts, clear signing is done via a single JSON parsing file.  

Here are the two ways to create the JSON file.  

### Automated process  
Using the codeless ERC7730 JSON builder.  
You can display the screens as you go along to see how the clear signing will look on a device. On this page, we take Aave as an example.  
Follow the [JSON Builder process](./json-builder) to build and submit your file.

  The tool is still in Alpha mode. If you encounter any errors, please provide feedback using [this form](https://tally.so/r/mObbWM).  
</Callout>

### Manual process
Instead of using the Builder, you can manually write the JSON:  
Refer to the example files  in the [registry directory](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry).  
Use the [JSON schema](https://eips.ethereum.org/assets/eip-7730/erc7730-v1.schema.json) and [specifications](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7730).  
Follow the [JSON Structure process](./smart-contract) to build and submit your file.
