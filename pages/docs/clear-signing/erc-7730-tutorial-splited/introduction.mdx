# Tutorial: How to write a ERC-7730 JSON file (split)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Use cases to manually write your file instead of using the [Json Builder tool](https://get-clear-signed.ledger.com/): 
    - To properly manage a set of contracts or messages.
    - To be able to upgrade your file if the contract evolves. In the tool, you cannot load and existing file to modify it yet.
    - To use complex features, such as include mechanisms or constants, and have a cleaner file overall.
    - To display a transaction field that is not in the ABI, such as `value`, `from` or `to`.

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to manually write a JSON file to implement clear signing for the transfer function of Tether USDT contract. By following this tutorial, you will learn how to manually edit an ERC-7730 JSON for more specific use cases, including multi versions smart contracts or EIP-712 messages.

This is the main structure of our file:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/erc7730-v1.schema.json",

    "context": {
        ...
    }, 

    "metadata": {
        ...
    },

    "display": {
        ...
    }
}
```

There are three main sections: `“context”`, `“metadata”` and `“display”`. We will deep dive into each of those sections to learn what their goal is, how to write them, and finally, how you can go further for more complex use cases.

    Basically, the main idea of each sections is: 
    - `“context”`: Provides binding context information for this file. Where should this file be applied?
    - `“metadata”`: Provides the contract/message metadata that can be displayed to the user. What will the user be able to see?
    - `“display”`: Provides info on how to format each fields of a function/message. How and when will the user be able to see those fields?

  <summary>For EIP-712 messages</summary>

    There are many similarities between smart contract and EIP-712, so this tutorial will also help you understand how you can clear sign EIP-712 messages. 
    However, in order to highlight the few differences, we will be referring to the following example from [1inch](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry/1inch/eip712-1inch-limit-order.json) to clear sign the `“OrderStructure”` message: 

    ```json    
    {
    "$schema": "../../specs/erc7730-v1.schema.json",

    "context": {
        ...
    },

    "metadata": {
        ...
    },

    "display": {
        ...
    }
    }
    ```

## Path Reference

Before getting started, we need to talk briefly about the path system. 

In addition to the [json path](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535) specification, you can use three additional roots to support description of paths over multiple files in a single common notation.

The root node identifier indicates which document or data location this path references, according to the following table:

| Root   |  Refers to  |  Value location  |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| # | Path applies to the structured data schema (ABI path for contracts, path in the message types itself for EIP-712). It is the default path if no root is specified   | Values can be found in the serialized representation of the structured data   |
| $ | Path applies to the current file describing the structured data formatting, after merging with includes   | Values can be found in the merged file itself   |
| @ | Path applies to the container of the structured data to be signed for smart contract. For EIP-712, @.to verifying contract.  @.chainid   | Values can be found in the serialized container to sign, and are uniquely defined per container in the Reference section   |

In combination of those root node identifer, for paths referring to structured data fields, if a field has a variable length primitive type (like `bytes` or `string` in solidity), a slice selector can be added to the path, to refer to the specific set of bytes indicated by the slice: `[xx:]`

Examples:
- `#.params.amountIn` or `params.amountIn` refers to parameter `amountIn` in top-level structure params as defined in the ABI.
- `$.display.definitions.minReceiveAmount` refers to a common definition reused across fields formatting definition.
- `@.value` refers to the enclosing transaction native currency amount.
- `#.params.path.[-20:]` refers to the last 20 bytes of the path byte array.

Detailed info [here in our spec](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/erc-7730.md#path-references). 

Now we are good to go, let’s get started.
