# 4. Advanced

This section will explain how you can go further with some advanced functions. 


## Include mechanism 

Smart contracts and EIP-712 messages are often re-using common interfaces or types that share similar display formatting. This specification supports a basic inclusion mechanism that enables sharing files describing specific interfaces or types.

The `includes` top-level key is a URL pointing to an ERC-7730 file that MUST follow this specification.

A wallet using an ERC-7730 file including another file SHOULD merge those files into a single reference file. When merging, conflicts between common unique keys are resolved by prioritizing the including file. 

- More info [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/erc-7730.md#organizing-files) in our spec.
- Example [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry/1inch/calldata-AggregationRouterV6-zksync.json) in the registry (1inch).

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../specs/erc7730-v1.schema.json",
  "includes": "common-AggregationRouterV6.json",
  "context": {
    "$id": "AggregationRouterV6",
    "contract": {
      "abi": "https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=contract&action=getabi&address=0x111111125421cA6dc452d289314280a0f8842A65",
      "deployments": [{ "chainId": 324, "address": "0x6fd4383cB451173D5f9304F041C7BCBf27d561fF" }]
    }
  }
}
```


## More complex types

A solidity function call can contain structures. The parameters themselves can be complex types, and the way we represent paths in those complex types is a little bit specific. 

We can use complex paths and types in order to pick a **specific value** that we want to clear sign.

Have a look at this example of the format section in a [1inch json file](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/registry/1inch/common-AggregationRouterV6.json):

```json
    "formats": {
      "swap(address executor, (address srcToken, address dstToken, address srcReceiver, address dstReceiver, uint256 amount, uint256 minReturnAmount, uint256 flags) desc, bytes data)": {
        "$id": "swap",
        "intent": "Swap",
        "fields": [
          { "path": "desc.amount", "$ref": "$.display.definitions.sendAmount", "params": { "tokenPath": "desc.srcToken" } },
          {
            "path": "desc.minReturnAmount",
            "$ref": "$.display.definitions.minReceiveAmount",
            "params": { "tokenPath": "desc.dstToken" }
          },
          { "path": "desc.dstReceiver", "$ref": "$.display.definitions.beneficiary" }
        ],
        "required": ["desc.amount", "desc.minReturnAmount", "desc.dstReceiver"],
        "excluded": ["executor", "desc.srcReceiver", "desc.flags", "data"]
      },
```

As you can see, some complex types are directly included in the swap function call: 
```json
"swap(address executor, (address srcToken, address dstToken, address srcReceiver, address dstReceiver, uint256 amount, uint256 minReturnAmount, uint256 flags) desc, bytes data)"
```

Let’s have a look at this path in the “fields” section: 
```json
{ "path": "desc.amount", "$ref": "$.display.definitions.sendAmount", "params": { "tokenPath": "desc.srcToken" } },
```

- `desc.amount`: refers to the value of the field `amount` from the structure `desc`, that has been defined above (in our case, `uint256`):
```json
"swap(address executor, (address srcToken, address dstToken, address srcReceiver, address dstReceiver, uint256 amount, uint256 minReturnAmount, uint256 flags) desc, bytes data)"
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The names we use in those paths (like `"path": "desc.minReturnAmount")` must match the ones from the ABI. 
</Callout>

This is how we can use complex paths and types to select a very specific value from the ABI, that we want to clear sign.
