## Why does your dApp or Wallet need Clear Signing?

"Blind signing" is a significant vulnerability that scammers exploit to steal funds from unsuspecting users. Suppose the only information given to the user is the transaction hash. In that case, it is challenging for users to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the transaction before signing because it is unreadable.

At Ledger, we are committed to building a secure Web3 ecosystem. To address this issue, we have introduced clear signing standards and tools. These tools provide user-readable and understandable data, making it easier for users to identify potential risks and verify transactions accurately.

We can format a transaction for human readability using the contractâ€™s ABI and metadata around the different fields. This way, users can verify the transaction before signing it, massively reducing the risk of scams.
