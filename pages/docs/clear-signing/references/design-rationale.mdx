# Design Rationale

The ERC-7730 standard was designed with several key considerations that influenced its structure and approach.

## Human Readability Focus

A primary goal of ERC-7730 is to balance developer usability with end-user benefits:

- The specification format is designed to be directly readable by developers
- JSON was chosen as a familiar, widely-supported format to lower the entry barrier
- The standard aims to make metadata file creation worth the effort by ensuring wide wallet support

## Hardware Wallet Limitations

The specification was significantly influenced by the constraints of hardware wallets:
- **Flattened Field Structure**: Complex UI constructs like layouts and grouping were left optional to accommodate limited hardware wallet displays
- **"Flattening" Approach**: The recommended approach for handling complex message structures is to flatten the field list, which works better on hardware wallets
- **Recursive Formatters**: Some formatters that require recursive processing (like calldata) may have limitations, especially on hardware wallets
