# Design Rationale Reference

This reference document catalogs the key design decisions and technical constraints that shaped the ERC-7730 standard.

## Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Human Readability | Balancing developer ergonomics with end-user comprehension |
| Hardware Wallet Support | Accommodating the technical limitations of secure hardware devices |
| Developer Adoption | Reducing barriers to implementation for wallet and dApp developers |

## Human Readability Considerations

The standard prioritizes human readability through several specific design choices:

### Developer-Friendly Specification Format
- The specification uses a syntax and structure designed for direct readability by developers
- Implementation patterns are documented alongside the specification to provide context

### JSON as Data Format
- JSON was selected as the primary data interchange format due to:
  - Widespread familiarity among developers
  - Extensive library support across programming languages
  - Native parsing capabilities in most development environments
  - Human-readable structure for debugging and implementation

### Adoption Incentives
- The standard incorporates incentives for metadata file creation:
  - Promises of wide wallet support for compliant implementations
  - Improved user experience as a direct result of implementation effort

## Hardware Wallet Design Constraints

Technical limitations of hardware wallets significantly influenced the specification:

### Display Limitations
| Constraint | Design Response |
|------------|-----------------|
| Limited screen size | Flattened field structure |
| UI rendering capabilities | Optional complex constructs (layouts/grouping) |
| Memory constraints | Optimized data structures |

### Field Structure Decisions

#### Flattened Field Structure
- Complex UI constructs like layouts and grouping were made optional
- Primary data fields prioritized for constrained displays
- Progressive enhancement pattern for more capable wallets

#### Message Structure Flattening
- Complex nested structures are discouraged
- Recommended approach converts nested objects to flattened field lists
- Improves display compatibility across hardware wallet types

#### Recursive Processing Limitations
- Formatters requiring recursive processing (e.g., calldata) have documented limitations
- Alternative patterns provided for hardware wallet implementations
- Graceful degradation paths for complex data structures
