# Enhancing Security through Clear Signing


## Why does your dApp or Wallet need clear signing?

Blind signing is a significant vulnerability that scammers exploit to steal funds from unsuspecting users. If the only information given to the user is the transaction hash, it is challenging for users to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the transaction before signing, because it is unreadable.

At Ledger, we are committed to building a secure Web3 ecosystem. That is why we have introduced clear signing standards and tools to address this issue. These tools provide user-readable and understandable data, making it easier for users to identify potential risks and verify transactions accurately.
