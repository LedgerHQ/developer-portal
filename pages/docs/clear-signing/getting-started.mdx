# What can be Clear Signed?

## Scope of ERC-7730

The objective of ERC-7730 is to establish a standardized method for clear signing contracts and messages on EVM chains, by offering metadata formatting that complements ABIs and message types.  
Anything included in the scope of ERC-7730 can be clear signed.  

### Smart Contract dApps

If you work on a dApp, checkout [dApps implementation with ERC-7730](./erc7730/process), describing the automated and manual processes.  

### EIP-712 messages

If you have EIP-712 messages,  checkout [JSON structure for EIP-712 messages](./eip712-messages)

### Wallets

If you work on a Wallet, checkout [Wallets implementation with the DMK and the DSK](./wallets)

### ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-20

For ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-20 tokens, follow [this documentation](./tokens)

## Notes 

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Currently, this implementation is supported for EVM chains only. Stay tuned for updates on other protocols!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Some special cases may require the development of an [Ethereum plugin](../device-app/getting-started). The Ledger team will guide you through this process if required.

## Generic Parser Status

The generic parser integrates the changes made to the repository, making them available on Ledger devices such as Ledger Flex and Ledger Stax. The “generic parser” serves as the middle layer deployed on the Ledger infrastructure to read and parse your JSON files.  

It’s used only for smart contract metadata parsing. EIP-712 JSON files are interpreted directly by the Ethereum device application.  

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Generic Parser Not Yet Ready:** Please be aware that the Ledger generic parser is currently undergoing development and is not yet operational. This means that even after your smart contract metadata is merged, it won't immediately be available on Ledger devices. We appreciate your patience and will notify you once the parser is fully functional and capable of integrating metadata with Ledger devices.
