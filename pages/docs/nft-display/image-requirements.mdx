		<tr>
			<td>Color profile</td>
			<td>The Ledger Stax screen supports up to <b>16 levels of gray (4-bit grayscale)</b>. We strongly recommend working with only 4-bit grayscale so that you can guarantee what the end result will look like on the device. You can alternatively work in Black & White (with a wider range of colors), but know that prior to being displayed on the device, the image will be converted to 4-bit grayscale and may not display how you would like.</td>
