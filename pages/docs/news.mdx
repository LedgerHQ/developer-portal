# Spring 2025

## Robin AI

Robin AI is our new AI assistant designed specifically for developers. It's now available in beta for all Ledger developers. [Try it now!](/robin).

## Moving away from Ledger Nano S

Ledger is transitioning away from the Ledger Nano S. As a result, new applications, feature submissions, and app updates on the Nano S will not be accepted. We recommend you begin planning for this transition now to ensure continuity for the users by:
- Warning your community that support of your blockchain app/wallet/service on the Nano S is not guaranteed
- Encouraging your community to upgrade to another Ledger device and check they have their 24-word Secret Recovery Phrase to maintain support

Ledger will provide documentation, tools, and support to help you phase out Ledger Nano S compatibility smoothly. As a reminder, you as the developer of Device Apps, assume complete responsibility for the functioning of this Device App and any potential damage this application may cause to end-users.
