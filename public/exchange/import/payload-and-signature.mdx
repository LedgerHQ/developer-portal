### Input field: nonce

A nonce field will be passed as a parameter of the **/swap** endpoint.  
It is a 32 bytes nonce which is generated by the hardware wallet to avoid replay attacks.  

### Output field: providerSig

The real return value of the **/swap** endpoint is the `providerSig` field with the JSON Web Signature (JWS) in compact form within:
- `providerSig.payload` - base64 URL of the binary serialized protobuf message.NewTransactionResponse.
- `providerSig.signature` - base64 URL of the ES256 signature of providerSig.payload. More details in the [JWS signature](#jws-signature) section.

### JWS-Signature
The output field is `providerSig`, and is based on the [flattened JWS JSON](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-7.2.2), without the optional `protected` and `header` parameters.

The algorithms supported by Ledger are [ES256](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3.4) with secp256k1 or secp256r1 curve. There is no need to specify them into the `header`,
as we will store your public key with this information in our system.

As specified in the JWA spec, the signature is a concatenation of the (R, S) pair in a 64 octets array, and not the ASN1 format.

The [JWS RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-5.1) requires the signature to be computed on: `<BASE64URL_HEADER>.<BASE64URL_PAYLOAD>`. As we don't require any `header`, the signature has to be computed on: `.<BASE64URL_PAYLOAD>`.
